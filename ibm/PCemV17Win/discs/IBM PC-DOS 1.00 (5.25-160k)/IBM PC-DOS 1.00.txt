IBM PC-DOS 1.00
Released in 1981 by IBM
For the IBM PC model 5150

Image quality: Verified as unmodified.

This is the first version of IBM PC-DOS released by IBM for the IBM
Personal Computer. It was based off of 86-DOS written by Tim
Patterson for Seattle Computer Products machines, bought by
Microsoft, and licensed to IBM. This version only supports single
sided 5.25" (160K) floppy drives. It does not support hard drives or
subdirectories.

Although it may boot on some clones, the included BASIC requires
IBM's BASIC in ROM.

This archive includes one 160K disk image in ImageDisk, Raw,
Teledisk, Transcopy, and PSI formats.

Important: This disk image is formatted for DOS 1.x which may not be
recognized by WinImage. We recommend you use ImageDisk to write this
to a floppy disk, or use the Raw image with an emulator.

DOS 1.x does not include the "55 AA" signature at the end of its boot 
sector. This signature was added later and intended for use with hard 
disks. However, many IBM PC clones will refuse to boot a floppy if 
this signature is not present. If you manually use a hex editor to 
add this signature to the boot sector, DOS 1.x will boot on most 
clones.
