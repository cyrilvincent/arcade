Utility overview
The Intel® processor serial number control utility is a Windows(R) program that enables 
or disables the reading of the Pentium(R) III  processor serial number by software. This 
allows users to control which software programs or websites have permission to read the 
processor serial number. When installed, the utility runs automatically each time the 
system is started.

This utility places an icon in the Windows(R) system tray to provide the user with a visual 
indication of the state of the processor serial number feature. The user has the option of 
hiding the system tray icon. Disabling the processor serial number can be done at 
any time, but enabling the serial requires the system to be restarted. 

System Requirements
The Intel processor serial number control utility requires
- A Pentium III processor-based system
- Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 (or later?)
- 2 megabytes of hard disc space

Installation
Run setup.exe from the directory where you unzipped the file. Note:  Attempting to 
install this utility on a system which does not contain a Pentium III processor will generate 
an error message.

Processor serial number overview
The Intel processor serial number is a new feature of the Pentium III processor which 
serves as an identifier for the processor. The processor serial number is designed to be 
unique, and when used in conjunction with other identification methods can be used to 
identify the system or user. This number can be used in a wide variety of applications 
which would benefit from stronger forms of system and user identification.

The processor serial number is analogous to a conventional serial number, with several 
important differences:  
- it can be read by a software application; or
- reading can be disabled via utility programs such as this one, or via the BIOS, 
depending on the system configuration.

Processor serial number and control utility FAQ.

1. What are the benefits of the processor serial number?
1A. The processor serial number will be used in applications which benefit from stronger 
forms of system and user identification, such as
- Applications using security capabilities
- Asset management
- Secure chat

2.  Why would I want to turn off my processor serial number?
2A. Intel believe the processor serial number will provide compelling benefits to users. 
They are developing features in conjunction with the processor serial number to allow 
responsible service providers to provide services which maintain your privacy. 
However, if you are concerned that a given application/service using your 
processor number may impact your privacy, you may turn it off  
using the Intel processor serial number control utility.

3. What is the default state of the processor serial number?
3A. The default state of the processor serial number is on, until the processor serial
number control utility is installed. Once the processor serial number control utility is
installed, it turns the processor serial number off by default. The user may turn the
processor serial number on using the utility.

4. Can a web site read my serial number without my knowledge?
4A. No, generally not.  Web sites cannot read serial numbers unless you allow them 
to download a program which can read the processor serial number. Almost all browsers 
are configured to warn users whenever they download executable software.  Unless you 
disable the warning in your browser, you should receive a notification.

5. Do Intel track serial numbers?
5A. Generally not, other than related to the manufacturing process.  Intel will not, in the 
absence of advance and express consent of a user, collect serial number data which is otherwise 
identified with a user.


6. What programs and/or web sites currently use the processor serial number?
6A. A complete list of programs which can take advantage of the processor serial number and 
other new capabilities of the Pentium III processor may be found at
http://www.intel.com/pentiumiii/utility.htm .


7. How can I tell if my processor serial number is turned on?
7A. The vast majority of Pentium III processor-based systems is shipped with the 
processor serial number enabled.  The control utility allows you to check the status by: 
 
1) the icon itself (the disabled icon shows a red circle with a white "x"); or
2) selecting the "Status" menu item by clicking on the task tray icon or 
	from the tool tip shown when the mouse is positioned over the task tray icon.
