INDICATE YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS vendor.doc.

=====================
KEY POINTS
=====================

[*] IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!
    FormGen, Inc., Gold Medallion Software and any authorized affiliate, have
    a WORLDWIDE EXCLUSIVE LICENCE to sell the shareware version of the Game
    (any version) during the initial year of release, in a retail or
    commercial location. (The exclusive ends May 1, 1996.)  All entities who
    violate this license will be pursued and prosecuted by FormGen, Inc.

[*] AFTER MAY 1, 1996, YOU MAY ONLY SELL AND DISTRIBUTE THE GAME IN A
    COMMERCIAL LOCATION AFTER OBTAINING WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM 3D REALMS.
    3D Realms reserves its right to withhold permission.

[*] Everyone can -- and is encouraged! -- to copy, upload and generally pass
    around this Game without charging for it.

[*] If you want to distribute the Game as provided in this vendor.doc, either
    by catalog, advertisement, BBS, on-line service, or direct mail, no
    written permission is needed.  3D Realms highly recommends that
    distribution be made from an original copy from 3D Realms or from one of
    its authorized sources, such as our home BBS (Software Creations BBS:
    508-368-7036) to prevent the sale of older versions.

[*] All advertising of the Program must include "Apogee" in the description.

[*] The Game is marked "Shareware" and contains "episode one".  No right is
    given by this vendor.doc to copy, use or distribute any other version,
    including any version that is registered, or not marked shareware, or that
    contains any episode other than #1.

      installation of the Game.

    terminate 30 days after you receive written notice, or such longer period
    as the notice may provide.  Following such termination, you may distribute
    the Game only until the earlier of 60 days after the termination date in
    the notice, or distribution of the copies you have in stock.  Sections [2],
    [5], and [6] survive termination.

[5] LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF REMEDIES: If 3D Realms provides a
    physically defective copy of the Game, 3D Realms will replace it upon

    NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

[6] MISCELLANY

 [A] Since 3D Realms would be irreparably damaged if Section [3], [4] or [6][D]
     were not specifically enforced, we will be entitled without bond, other
     security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with
     respect to breaches of such sections, in addition to such other remedies
     as we may have.

 [B] You will hold us, our partners, affiliates, contractors, employees and
     agents harmless from damage, loss and expense arising directly or
     indirectly from your acts and omissions in copying and distributing the
     Game, including from any installation routine that you may add.

 [C] With respect to every matter arising under this, you consent to the
     exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts sitting
     in Dallas, Texas, and to service by certified mail, return receipt
     requested, or as otherwise permitted by law.
