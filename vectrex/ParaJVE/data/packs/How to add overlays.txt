 HOW TO ADD YOUR OWN OVERLAYS INTO PARAJVE EMULATION
=====================================================

The overlay files are standard image files that are loaded by ParaJVE to create
an OpenGL texture used to render the vectrex overlay. The standard PNG, JPG and
BMP formats are supported, and the alpha channel of the image (transparency) is
used as is to define the transparent areas of the overlay.

An overlay is split into 2 different images : One image for the 'opaque' areas
of the overlay, and another for the 'transparent' areas. The transparent image 
goes through the post-processing steps when it is displayed (color/brightness 
blending using OpenGL shaders). On the other hand, the opaque image (whose name 
is suffixed with a dollar character) is merely textured as is ( ithout any 
special graphics processing) at the end of the rendering process , over the 
resulting backbuffer image.

If you want to design your own overlay for ParaJVE, you might want to work 
with an additional black background layer, as it will give a good idea of 
what the overlay will look like when rendered through the ParaJVE engine.

If you want to add your own overlay for a game, all you have to do is copy 
the image file(s) in this folder, and refer to it using a relative path in
the associated game entry of the configuration file.

Please note that overlay FILES take precedence over the overlays stored in 
the PACK (overlays.jvepak), so your own files will be used even if their names
are the same as the one of an overlay defined in the pack. This lets you change
the default overlays if you want to.


As an example, here is the steps that ParaJVE will perform to load an overlay
that has been defined in the configuration file as :

		<game id="MY_GAME" name="My Own Game">
		  [...]
			<overlay [...] path="data/packs/MyOverlay.png" />
			[...]
		</game>

1. Try to load the image from the local file "data/packs/MyOverlay.png"
   If successful, use this image as the overlay transparent texture (go to step 4)

2. Try to load the image with the id "MYOVERLAY.PNG" from the pack file
   If successful, use this image as the overlay transparent texture (go to step 4)

3. No overlay image found, disable overlay for this gaming session (STOP).

4. Try to load the image from the local file "data/packs/MyOverlay$.png"
   If successful, use this image as the overlay opaque texture (STOP), otherwise, continue to 5.

5. Try to load the image with the id "MYOVERLAY$.PNG" from the pack file
   If successful, use this image as the overlay opaque texture (STOP), otherwise, continue to 6.

3. No opaque overlay image found, just render the transparent overlay for this gaming session (STOP).
