<b><u>MISSION GOAL</u></b><br><ul>

Your goal is to command your sector of the nebula by conquering 
opposing forces. You do this by mining space crystals to build up your energy 
reserves. These reserves are used to construct combat vehicles, deep space 
missiles and to power your mining beam and system defense shield. 
 
Nebula Commander can be operated <i>player 1</i> vs. the Vectrex, or <i>player 1</i>
vs. <i>player 2</i> simultaneous if you have 2 gaming controllers (highly recommended!).


</ul><br><b><u>GAME SELECTION</u></b><br><ul>

After the Vectrex has finished its power-up, the user can select game 
options on the player 1 controller. Toggle between 1 player game and 2
player game using button 1. Toggle between the different game types using 
buttons 2 and 3. <br>
<br>
Game options are :<ul>
<li type=DISC>Game 1 : Best-of-3 competition </li>
<li type=DISC>Game 2 : Best-of-5 competition </li>
<li type=DISC>Game 3 : Marathon </li>
</ul>
<br>
When you are ready to begin press button 4.<br>
<br>
In the <i>Best-of competitions</i>, a winner will be declared once the 
designated number of combat rounds has elapsed. Both nebula victories and 
total score are tracked so try to win in both!<br>
<br>
In the <i>Marathon game</i>, there is no limit to the number of combat 
rounds. Gam e stats will be presented between each round. To exit 
Marathon mode, press reset on the Vectrex.


</ul><br><b><u>SPACE STATIONS</u></b><br><ul>

Each player is in command of a space station. This station is a circular 
planetoid, with <i>player 1</i> always appearing on the right side of space, and 
<i>player 2</i> appearing in a complementary position on the left side of space.<br>
<br>
<!-- INSERT stations pictures here -->

The players’ health and energy reserves are displayed inside each 
space station. <br>The station’s health is represented by the left bar. When 
this bar is full, the station is safe. When this bar is nearly gone, the station 
is about to explode. Health is non-recoverable, so guard it well. The 
station’s energy is displayed by the right bar. Operating the station and 
building combat items consumes energy. To regain energy capture space 
crystals that float into your sector of space or wait for solar panels to 
charge the energy tanks very slowly.
 

</ul><br><b><u>HOW TO MINE</u></b><br><ul>

To fuel your war machine, you must receive a constant supply of 
energy. A small part of this energy is supplied by solar panels, but the 
largest reserves come from space crystals.<br>
<!-- <br>
...Space crystals...<br> -->
<br>
To collect a crystal, it must pass over your space station. You can use 
your tractor beam to help pull space crystals toward your station. Move 
your targeting cursor onto the space crystal and press button 4. If you have 
enough energy to activate the tractor beam ,it will fire to your cursor. If 
your cursor is close to a space crystal, the beam will lock on and the crystal
will begin to move toward your station.<br>
<!-- <br>
...Player 1 Cursor - Player 2 Cursor... <br> -->
<br>
The beam will continue to tractor the crystal as long as button 4 is held.
 

</ul><br><b><u>HOW TO BUILD</u></b><br><ul>

To build a missile or space destroyer, you must move your cursor onto 
your own space station. Then press button 3 to build a missile or button 2 to 
build a destroyer. You may at any one-time command up to 5 missiles and 2
space destroyers. Each destroyer can command 1 additional missile.<br>
<!-- <br>
...Player 1 Space Destroyer ... Player 2 Space Destroyer...<br>
...5 missilesready to deploy...<br> -->


</ul><br><b><u>HOW TO DEPLOY</u></b><br><ul>

To fire a missile, or to redirect a missile already in flight, move your 
cursor to the desired target and press button 3. Each time you press button 3,
the next missile in turn will be targeted at your current cursor location.
You must plan ahead since you cannot specifically choose to target and re-target
a certain missile before its turn. Note that missiles cannot target 
precisely from far away and may need further targeting once they get closer 
to their targets.<br>
<br>
To launch a space destroyer, or to retarget a space destroyer, move 
your cursor to the desired target and press button 2. Each time you press 
button 2, the next destroyer will be targeted at your current cursor 
location. You must plan ahead since you cannot specifically choose to target 
and re-target a certain destroyer before its turn.<br>
Once a space destroyer comes within range of its target it will begin 
to fire missiles. Each destroyer can command only 1 missile at a time. Space 
destroyers can be eliminated with several shots from the opponent’s missiles.


</ul><br><b><u>HOW TO DEFEND</u></b><br><ul>

If you are under imminent attack, you may choose to deploy the 
station’s deflector shield. The shield consumes a fair amount of energy, but 
eliminates all damage from missile impact. To activate the shield, press 
button 1. The shield will continue to operate while button 1 is held, and also 
for a short time after it is released. This time is required to shut down the 
plasma reactors safely.
 

</ul><br><b><u>SCORE</u></b><br><ul>

On your quest for nebular domination, points are awarded for 
successful combat events as follows:<br>

</ul><br><b><u>TIPS</u></b><br><ul>

<li>Don’t run your energy all the way down. You will be forced to wait for 
solar energy to charge your tanks enough to begin operating the tractor 
beam again. The beam does not consume a lot of energy, but it does need 
some.</li>
<li>The deflector shield takes a moment to shut down. Try to time the 
release of the shield button to minimize shield energy consumption.</li>
<li>You don’t have to tractor the crystals all the way to the station. Just 
get them on a collision course.</li>
<li>You can play tug of war with the opponent over a space crystal. Learn 
when this is advantageous, and when to let it go.</li>
<li>Space destroyers are a real threat since they continually generate 
missiles. However they have no shield and limited structural integrity.
Eliminate destroyers quickly before they do too much damage.</li>
