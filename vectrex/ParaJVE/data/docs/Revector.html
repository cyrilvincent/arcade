<b><u>MISSION GOAL</u></b><br><ul>

Your goal is to outscore your opponent in a 7 minute timed match. You 
score points by shooting your opponent and by picking up power-up items.
Revector can be operated <i>player 1</i> vs. the Vectrex, or <i>player 1</i>
vs. <i>player 2</i> simultaneous if you have 2 gaming controllers 
(highly recommended!).

</ul><br><b><u>GAME SELECTION</u></b><br><ul>

After the Vectrex has finished its power-up, the user can select game 
options on the player 1 controller. Toggle between 1 player game and 2 
player game using button 1. Toggle between the different game types using 
buttons 2and 3. <br>
<br>
Game options are :<ul>
<li type=DISC>Game 1 : Standard game </li>
<li type=DISC>Game 2 : No Power-up items </li>
<li type=DISC>Game 3 : No Power-up items, no automatic weapon </li>
</ul>
<br>
When you are ready to begin press button 4.


</ul><br><b><u>STATUS DISPLAY</u></b><br><ul>

Player and game status information is displayed at the top of the 
screen. In the middle is a display of the current game time, which starts at 
07:00 minutes and counts down to 00:00. Player 1 information is displayed 
on the right side, while player 2 (or the computer player) information is on 
the left. Each display includes from top down: score, health &amp; energy. The 
score is your tally of your points. The health and energy displays consist of 
icons (<i>heart</i> for health, <i>star</i> for energy) and bars. When a bar is full, the 
corresponding health or energy is full. When it is low, the player is partially 
depleted. <br>
<br>
If your health bar is gone completely, you will lose a vehicle and 
the opponent will be awarded 1500 points. Whenever one, or both vehicles 
are destroyed, a newround of fighting is started until the game time has 
elapsed. If your energy bar is gone completely, you will not be able to fire 
your weapon. The energy bar is slowly recharged automaticaly, but the 
health bar can only be replenished by picking up a power-up item.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of a round, both players’ health is full, and both players’
energy is fully depleted.


</ul><br><b><u>HOW TO DRIVE</u></b><br><ul>

After game selection is complete, the game will begin. The players will
be placed on their corresponding sides of the screen in a random position.
Player 1 always begins on the right half of the screen and player 2 (or the 
computer player) begins on the left in a complementary position.<br>
<br>To turn 
counter-clockwise or clockwise, move the joystick left or right. To 
accelerate your vehicle forward or back, press the joystick up or down. You 
may bounce off of the walls (or the opponent!) without injury.

</ul><br><b><u>HOW TO FIGHT</u></b><br><ul>

To fire your vehicle’s semi-automatic weapon, press button 4 on your 
controller. To fire your vehicle’s automatic weapon, press button 3 on your 
controller. Note that the fully automatic weapon is not available in game 3,
and button 3 will fire a single shot. If the player picks up smart bullets,
button 4 will use the smart weapon, while button 3 will continue to use the 
standard weapon.<br>
<br>
Once fired all projectiles become armed immediately, and 
can harm either player. A projectile can bounce off of the walls up to 3
times, but will self-destruct upon hitting the 4th wall. The player may have 
up to 5 projectiles on the screen at a time, and cannot fire a 6th projectile 
even if reserve energy is available.


</ul><br><b><u>POWER-UP ITEMS</u></b><br><ul>

In game 1, power-up items will appear randomly on the playing field.
To collect the power-up, drive your vehicle over the top of the item.
A unique sound for each item will be heard indicating that you have been 
awarded that item. The power-ups are:<ul>

<br><li type=DISC><b>Health Recharge</b><br>
The heart will fully refill your vehicle’s health reserve.<br>
<i>You will also receive <u>25 points</u>.</i></li>

<br><li type=DISC><b>Energy Recharge</b><br>
The star will fully refill your vehicle’s energy reserve.<br>
<i>You will also receive <u>75 points</u>.</i></li>

<br><li type=DISC><b>Money</b><br>
<i>The dollar sign will give you <u>1000 points</u>.</i></li>
 
<br><li type=DISC><b>Freeze</b><br>
The toggling arrow will freeze a vehicle’s driving controls for a short time.<br>
<i>You will also receive <u>125 points</u>.</i><p>
When the arrow points to the right, player 1 will be frozen. When the
arrow points to the left, player 2 will be frozen. Be careful not to
freeze yourself! You cannot turn or accelerate while frozen, but you can fire.</li>
 
<br><li type=DISC><b>Invisible</b><br>
The spiral will make the vehicle invisible for a short time.<br>
<i>You will also receive <u>200 points</u>.</i><p>
If you are hit while invisible, you will become visible briefly. Beware that
invisibility does not fool the Smart Bullets!</li>
 

<br><li type=DISC><b>Smart Bullets</b><br>
The 4-point star will add 10 smart bullets to your cache.<br>
<i>You will also receive <u>150 points</u>.</i><p>
The player’s energy bar icon will be changed from the 5-point star to the
4-point star to indicate that smart bullets are available. When all smart
bullets are used, this icon will return to the 5-point star. Smart bullets
will bounce toward the opponent vehicle after each bounce off of the
playfield wall. Fire a smart bulet by pressing button 4 on the controller.</li>
