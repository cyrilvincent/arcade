    <div class="pad-right">
    <p class="FL">ParaJVE comes with a Graphical User Interface that makes it easy to select the game
    to be ran&nbsp;; this is usually the preferred way to start a gaming session.
    Some users, however, may have more specific needs (homebrew developers, or third party 
    front-end users, for instance), that's why ParaJVE provides several different ways to 
    tweak its launching. This section describes the different options available.
    </div>

    <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <p class="title2"><A name="launch_cmd"/>Command line parameters and switches</p><div class="entry">

    <p class="FL">The emulator now supports a larger set of command line parameters. They can
    be added at the end of the script line invoking the java runtime (by editing 
    <code>ParaJVE.bat</code> on windows, or <code>ParaJVE</code> on other platforms).
    Here is the list of supported parameters and switches&nbsp;:
    <p>
    <table class="special" cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 border=0>  <!-- width=90% align=center  -->
        <tr>

                This optional parameter is used to bypass the game selector dialog. When it is present, ParaJVE will automatically load the specified game without opening the game selector dialog.  The value can take one of the three following forms&nbsp;:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>-game=SELECTED</b><br>to load the game that was last executed by ParaJVE.<p></li>

                    <li><b>-game=&lt;&nbsp;<i>Path</i>&nbsp;&gt;</b><br>to load a specific ROM that's not included in ParaJVE. &lt;&nbsp;<i>Path</i>&nbsp;&gt; is the path to the ROM file to be used (either an absolute path, or relative to ParaJVE main folder).

    <p class="title2"><A name="launch_other"/>Launching a game that is not included within the ParaJVE distribution</p><div class="entry">

    <p class="FL">ParaJVE comes with a rather complete games bundle, but there will be occurrences
    when you want to run an extra game that is not included within the original ROMs package, or 
    when an homebrew developer would like to assemble and/or test his latest code in the emulator.
    There are several ways to proceed (some are making use of the Graphical User Interface, others 
    are Command-Line based).

    <p>
    <a name="launch_cmd_path">
    <li><b>Direct execution of an external ROM binary</b> (command-line)&nbsp;:</li><ol>
        This method can be used to instruct ParaJVE to directly load an <i>external</i> ROM 
        binary without poping up the game selection dialog. This is especially geared towards 
        homebrew developers as it will allow them to integrate the emulator more tightly in 
        their development cycle. With this feature, they can invoke ParaJVE directly from 
        within their preferred IDE and make it execute their current work (provided that their 
        IDE can invoke external tools, for assembling the source then call ParaJVE).
        <p>
        All you have to do is setup your IDE so that it calls ParaJVE with the extra 
        <code><nobr>-GAME</nobr></code> parameter whose value is the <i>path</i> of the binary ROM (that
        should have been assembled prior by your IDE). For a complete description of the <code>GAME</code> parameter, you can further 
        read <a href=#launch_cmd_game>this&nbsp;section</a>.
    </ol>

    <a name="launch_binary">
    <li><b>Executing an external ROM binary</b> (GUI)&nbsp;:</li><ol>
        This method can be used to run an <i>external</i> game ROM (downloaded from the internet,
        for instance).
        <p>
        In the game selection dialog, click the <code>"Select another ROM"</code> button, and 
        browse to the file containing the binary ROM to be ran. Once done, click the 
        <code>"Run Game"</code> button, and ParaJVE will be launched with the specified binary.
    </ol>

    <a name="launch_asm">
    <li><b>Executing an external ROM source</b> (GUI)&nbsp;:</li><ol>
        This method is likely to be used by homebrew developers that use the AS09 assembler only&nbsp;:
        it instructs ParaJVE to assemble some 6809 source code, and load the resulting binary
        (rather than directly loading an already assembled ROM).
        <p>
        In the game selection dialog, click the <code>"Assemble Source"</code> button, and
        browse to the <i>main</i> source file to be be assembled. Once done, click the
        <code>"Build ROM &amp; Run Game"</code> button. The AS09 assembler is then invoked to
        build the ROM, and if successful, the generated binary is loaded by ParaJVE. If an error
        occurs during the assembly phase, an error dialog will notify you about the problem.
    </ol>

    <a name="launch_reload">
    <li><b>Reloading or ReAssembling a loaded ROM</b> (GUI)&nbsp;:</li><ol>
        This is not a Launching method per se, it is rather a trick to avoid the need for a
        relaunch ; its purpose is to force ParaJVE to reload a ROM binary (or reassemble a 
        source) if for some reasons its content changed since it was first loaded.
        <p>
        In the emulator menu, select the <code>[Debug<nobr>-&gt;</nobr> Reload Cartridge ROM]</code> 
        menu item (or <code>[Debug<nobr>-&gt;</nobr> Rebuild Cartridge ROM]</code> if you started the 
        emulator with some source code as described <a href=#launch_asm>here</a>). The ROM is
        then reloaded (or rebuilt, displaying a message in case of assembly error), and a
        dialog asks whether the emulator should be reset or not. Clicking the <code>YES</code>
        button will <i>reboot</i> ParaJVE (ie. perform a <i>clean</i> restart), whereas clicking 
        <code>NO</code> will let the emulation resume its execution without any reset.
        <p> 
        Unless you know exactly what you do, the <code>NO</code> option is usually discouraged, 
        as it resumes execution in the same exact state as when it was suspended (excepting for 
        the cartridge memory area that has just been reloaded or rebuilt), the other memory 
        areas and sub-systems (CPU and chips) are left untouched... For instance, you could 
        very well end up with the PC register pointing to a cartridge address that is not 
        intended to be executed anymore - and this is only one funny scenario amongst many others!
    </ol>

    </div>
    <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <p class="title2"><A name="launch_skip"/>Skipping the game selection dialog</p><div class="entry">

    <p class="FL">For the users that launch the emulator through a third party front-end,
    ParaJVE can easily be started directly (ie. without poping up the <i>game selection</i>
    dialog). In order to do so, all you have to do is make use of the <code><nobr>-GAME</nobr>=&lt;<i>identifier</i>&gt;</code> 
    command-line parameter (as described in <a href=#launch_cmd_game>here</a>).
    <p>
    Also, for the developers that seek a way to invoke ParaJVE with their assembled ROM
    directly from within their IDE, have a look at <a href=#launch_cmd_path>this&nbsp;section</a>.

    (attaching another device will unplug the old peripheral first)&nbsp; when a gameport has 
    no device plugged-in, the <code>Empty</code> device (fake device place holder) is used.

    <p class="FL">The basic peripheral for the vectrex is its joystick (made of two analog 
    axis, along with four fire buttons). This device is of course emulated, and unless 
    you change it, a joystick is plugged by default in each gameport. 
    To support the joystick(s), ParaJVE maps some of your keyboard's keys (hitting these
    keys will make the emulator act as if the corresponding joystick button/axis was operated).
    <p>
    To change the current key-mapping and tweak it to your needs, select the <code>[Controls<nobr>-&gt;</nobr>
    Key Mapping]</code> menu item. Then, in the <code>Joystick#1</code> or <code>Joystick#2</code>
    tabs, click on the buttons you want to configure, and simply hit the key you want to
    be bound to that button.

    <p class="FL">ParaJVE can also handle any gamepad physically connected to your computer and map it 
    to a virtual vectrex joystick (instead of using the keyboard). To use a physical controller 
    within ParaJVE, it must have been connected <i>before</i> the emulator started (otherwise
    ParaJVE will not see this controller as available). Every detected controller will be 
    listed under the <code>[Controls<nobr>-&gt;</nobr> Game Port<nobr>-&gt;</nobr> Controller]</code> sub-menus.
    <br>
    To assign a physical controller to one of the two vectrex gameports, select the associated 
    sub-menu entry. A dialog will then appear, letting you configure the mapping between 
    the controller buttons/axis and the virtual joystick. Once validated, you can use your
    controller to play in the emulator.
    <p>
    <p class="FL">The vectrex games can poll the joystick using two different modes : either <i>Digital</i>,
    or <i>Analog</i>. These modes do not change the way the buttons work (they are always 
    polled as being either pressed or released) ; the difference lies in  the way the axis 
    coordinates are handled.
    <p>
    <li><b>Digital Mode</b> &nbsp;:</li><ol>
        The <i>Digital</i> mode is the default one in ParaJVE, because it is the standard
        used by most games. This mode does not take advantage of the (accurate) analog 
        values of the joystick, it only cares for the general direction in which the axis
        are oriented. 
        For instance, it doesn't matter if you have the stick fully moved to the right or just half-way, 
        as in both case the system will only note that the X axis is right-oriented.   
        <p>
        While operating in <i>Digital</i> mode, ParaJVE will use the four directions keys
        to control the joystick axis (as defined in the <a href="#mapping">key mapping configuration</a>).  
    </ol>
    <p>
    <li><b>Analog Mode</b> &nbsp;:</li><ol>
        A few games make use of the vectrex joysticks analog capabilities (<i>Hyperchase</i>,
        <i>Star Sling 4K</i> and <i>Patriots III</i> to mention a few). This means that 
        these games will not only care about the direction of the joystick axis; they will
        also look at <i>how far</i> the joystick moves along the axis, and will use this
        value to adjust the actions taken.
        ParaJVE cannot handle this mode with just four directions button (as it does in
        <i>digital</i> mode) ; that's why it will use the Mouse moves to emulate this mode. 
        <p>
        To enter <i>Analog</i> mode, you must first have a (virtual) joystick plugged in 
        the target gameport, and operating in <i>digital</i> mode (this is the case by 
        default). Then, double-click anywhere in the emulator window. As a result, the 
        <i>Analog</i> mode will be activated (the mouse cursor vanishing is an indication),
        and from now on, every mouse move will be converted as an analog move in the 
        corresponding virtual joystick. This will last until you switch back to <i>digital</i>
        mode, by clicking any mouse button.
        <br>
        Note that double-clicking the left mouse button will enter <i>analog</i> mode for the
        joystick plugged in the first gameport (if any), while double-clicking with the right
        mouse button will operate on the joystick plugged in the second gameport, if any.

    <p class="title2"><A name="periph_lightpen"/>Lightpen Emulation</p><div class="entry">

    <p class="FL">The lightpen is a legacy peripheral that was supported by a very small
    set of original games. It is a kind of <i>pen</i>, dragged around 
    the screen by the user, that detects the light emitted by the display beam. This 
    device is emulated within ParaJVE (since version 0.6.0) by using the Mouse moves.
    <p>
    When starting one of the four embedded games that requires the lightpen, this device
    is automatically assigned to the appropriate gameport, so it is immediately available.
    If you <a href="#launch_binary">launch an external ROM</a> that makes use of the 
    Lightpen <i><nobr>- MailPlane</nobr>, <nobr>anyone? ;) -</nobr></i>, you will have to
    plug it manually (using the <code>[Controls<nobr>-&gt;</nobr> Game Port #2<nobr>-&gt;</nobr>
    LightPen]</code> menu item) to activate its emulation.
    <p>
    When the lightpen is plugged in, the Mouse Pointer is replaced with a Cross that 
    figures the position of the lightpen on the screen. By default, the lightpen is 
    considered inactive (it cannot detect the light beam) as long as no mouse button is 
    pressed. It becomes active when either (or both) the Left or Right mouse button(s)
    is(are) pressed. If the Right mouse button is pressed, the lightpen operates in 
    accurate mode (that means that its precision is greater than normal, but also that
    it is likely to loose track of the light more easily if you move the mouse too fast).

    <p class="title2"><A name="periph_keyboard"/>PS/2 Keyboard adapter Emulation</p><div class="entry">

    <p class="FL">The PS/2 adapter is a connector (created in 2007) that provides a way to
    connect a PS/2 keyboard into the vectrex second gameport (and let the vectrex program 
    access the keyboard hits).
    <p>
    When the Keyboard Adapter is plugged into the game port, it remains <i>inactive</i> 
    until you press the engagement key (<code>PAGE_UP</code> by default). Once the keyboard
    has been activated, it will intercept any keypress (including the keys already mapped
    to joysticks or the general keys) and forward them to the gameport. This will last 
    until the keyboard is disengaged (by pressing <code>PAGE_DOWN</code> by default).
    <p>
    ParaJVE does not embed any game making use of this adapter so far, so its emulation
    for the time being is aimed at homebrew developers that wish to write some code that
    uses this adapter.

    <p class="title2"><A name="periph_vecvoice"/>VecVoice Emulation</p><div class="entry">

    <p class="FL">The VecVoice is a passive peripheral, as it does not require any user 
    action to carry out its task (it is a sound synthesizer that is entirely driven by
    the vectrex program, through the gameport signals). Therefore, 'using' the VecVoice
    emulation is as simple as pluging it into the second gameport, and let the VecVoice-enabled
    games operate it!
    <p>
    So far, the only embedded game that makes use of the VecVoice is <code>Verzerk</code>,
    and launching this game automatically instructs ParaJVE to plug the VecVoice in the
    gameport, so you don't even have to do anything to have it working. However, if you 
    happen to <a href="#launch_binary">launch an external ROM</a> that makes use of the 
    VecVoice, you will have to plug it manually (using the <code>[Controls<nobr>-&gt;</nobr> Game 
    Port #2<nobr>-&gt;</nobr> VecVoice]</code> menu item) to enjoy its emulation.
