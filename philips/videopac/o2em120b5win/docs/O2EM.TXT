---------------------------------------------------------------------------


O2EM is an open source Odyssey2 / Videopac console emulator, created by
Daniel Boris in 1996. Since version 0.80 it has been developed by André de
la Rocha and since version 1.16 it has been developed by Arlindo M. de Oliveira.
This version is an unofficial release by manopac, who was not happy with the
features that were missing and that o2em did not work properly on his Windows 7 
notebook.

This release includes the binaries for the Windows version of O2EM v1.20.
The sources can also be compiled under other platforms that support the Allegro 
game library. The binary versions for Linux/X11 and DOS continue to be available 
just until version 1.16 on sourceforge.

With the Windows binary, the necessary version of the Allegro DLL is also
included. To use the Linux version you must get the Allegro library for Linux
yourself and install it as root. The DOS version does not need additional
files.

O2EM is a command line based program, but there are several Windows frontends
you can use. The "official" one is O2EM Launcher, created by Heitor
Barcellos. (This unofficial version also has a built in fileselector if started 
without a rom-file.)

In order to build O2EM from its sources, you need either the MingW or Cygwin
packages on Windows, DJGPP on DOS and GCC on Linux. See the links below.

The latest official version of O2EM can be found at http://o2em.sourceforge.net

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick Setup:

To get O2EM up and running quickly follow these steps:

1. Unzip the O2EM archive on your hard drive, that will create the necessary 
   standard directories: ROMS, BIOS and VOICE into the main directory O2EM118.
2. Download the bios ROM O2ROM.BIN (or G7400.BIN, or C52.BIN, or JOPAC.BIN) 
   and put it into BIOS directory.
3. Download one or more game ROMs, for example KCMUNCH.BIN for KC Munchkin and
   put the ROM in ROMS directory.
4. From the O2EM118 directory type: o2em KCMUNCH.BIN to start the game.If you want
   to play KC Munchkin with VP+ BIOS, type: o2em KCMUNCH.BIN -g7400 
   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup:

    Before you can run O2EM you need a copy of the Odyssey2 or Videopac bios
ROM. For copyright reasons, this ROM image can not be included in this
archive. This ROM image is stored inside the 8048 processor and can be read
out with the appropriate equipment. The image should be 1024 bytes long and
should be in the BIOS directory in the main directory O2EM118.

    You will also need cartridge images, but again for copyright reasons
these can not be provided. PLEASE DO NOT E-mail us asking for ROM images! All
messages asking for ROM images will be promptly deleted.

    If you wish to use Voice emulation for games like KC's Krazy Chase. 
Download the voice samples and unzip them into the VOICE directory
into the main directory O2EM118. There are two sets of voice samples, 
mainsamp.zip which is the main voice samples and sidsamp.zip which are the
samples used by the game Sid the Spellbinder. You only need the Sid samples
if you want voice in that game.

Usage:


o2em [<file>/<path>] [options]

<file> = file to load with extension
	If the filename is omitted, the integrated file browser is started with the 
	directory given as "romdir" (default directory "roms"). If a path is specified 
	instead of a file, the file browser starts in this  directory

options:

-help	      Help display

-wsize=n      Window size used by the emulator (1=original, 2=double size, etc.)

-fullscreen   Use full screen mode

-scanlines    Enable scanlines use by the video emulation. Scanlines are a
              feature that makes your display look like a TV screen.

-nosound      Turn off sound emulation

-novoice      Turn off voice emulation

-svolume=n    Set sound volume (0-100)

-vvolume=n    Set voice volume (0-100)

-debug        Start the emulator in debug mode

-speed=n      Relative speed (100 = original speed)

-nolimit      Turn off speed limiter

-bios=file    Set the file name and directory to find the console
	      bios. By default it looks for a file named o2rom.bin.
       	      You can use a bios file from an Odyssey2, Videopac or
       	      Videopac+ console. If you want to run VP+ games (in 
	      VP+ mode) then you need a VP+ bios.

-romdir=path  Set the directory to find the game rom. By default it
	      looks for path named roms

-biosdir=path Set the directory to find the console bios. By default it
	      looks for path named bios

-o2rom        Start the emulator with Odyssey 2 bios (default for most games).

-c52          Start the emulator with french Odyssey 2 bios.

-g7400        Start the emulator with VP+ bios (default for detected VP+ only games).

-jopac        Start the emulator with french VP+ bios. 

-euro         This option enables the use of European timing / 50Hz mode.

-ntsc         This option enables the use of NTSC (US) timing / 60Hz mode.

-filter       Enable the low-pass audio filter.

-scshot=file  Set the screen shot file name or template. The screen shot
              will be saved when you press the F8 key in the emulator.
              The extension of the file you give will set the file type.
              supported file types are bmp, pcx and tga. You can also give
              a template to save several files, using the @ character.
              Using an option like -scshot=dump@.bmp will save files with
              names like dump00.bmp, dump01.bmp, etc. The pictures will
              have a resolution of (320x240)*wsize.

-exrom        Enable the use of an alternative ROM mapping for 4Kb games, to
	      support some games that use a special 3kb program rom/1kb data
	      ROM mode. The only known that use it are Four in 1 Row and
	      Musician and both are detected by their CRC and set correctly.
	      So this option is to be used only with games that are currently
	      unknown to O2EM. Do not enable it as default, as it will make
	      all the 4kb games that do not use this special mode crash.
              
-s0=QUIT,PAUSE,DEBUG,RESET,SCREENCAP,SAVE,LOAD,INJECT_HIGH,SWAP_JOYSTICKS,QUICKLOAD_BASIC,QUICKSAVE_BASIC,COPY_VPPCHARS
	      These option defines which keys are used for some of the system 
	      keys, if you use this option, you have to enter all 12 keys, to 
	      override the original keys (ESC,F1,F4,F5,F8,F2,F3,F6,F7,F9,F10,F11)

-joyautodetect	autodetect joysticks (real joysticks first, if not present 
				fall back to keyboard emulation)

-joydefaultoff	disable joysticks on startup (same as pressing SCROLL LOCK)
				joysticks can be enabled again at any time using SCROLL LOCK again
				(usefull if no real sticks are connected for all the games that do 
				not require joysticks or for C7420 emulation - Joystick off and 
				enabled only when needed)

-s1=mode/keys Define stick 1 mode/keys
-s2=mode/keys Define stick 2 mode/keys

              These options define how the console joysticks are emulated.
              For autodetection just use -joyautodetect.
              You can use a joystick connected to your computer or use
              the keyboard. You can specify a mode number (compatible with
              previous versions of O2EM) to disable the joystick emulation,
              to select an actual joystick or to set a default keyboard
              emulation mode :
                0=Disable,
                1=Default Right keys (arrows keys and L)
                2=Default Left keys (W,S,A,D,SPACE)
                3=Joystick
              Example: -s1=1 -s2=3
                                 
              You can also specify a list of 5 keyboard codes that will
              be used to emulate the joystick, separated by comas
              (without spaces), using this order : UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT,FIRE.
              The following codes are accepted (not case sensitive):
                A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,
                0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
                0_PAD,1_PAD,2_PAD,3_PAD,4_PAD,5_PAD,6_PAD,7_PAD,8_PAD,9_PAD,
                TILDE, MINUS, EQUALS, BACKSPACE, TAB, OPENBRACE, CLOSEBRACE,
                ENTER, COLON, QUOTE, BACKSLASH, BACKSLASH2, COMMA, STOP,
                SLASH, SPACE, INSERT, DEL, HOME, END, PGUP, PGDN, LEFT,
                RIGHT, UP, DOWN, SLASH_PAD, ASTERISK, MINUS_PAD, PLUS_PAD,
                DEL_PAD, ENTER_PAD, PRTSCR, PAUSE, ABNT_C1, YEN, KANA, AT,
                CIRCUMFLEX, COLON2, KANJI, LSHIFT, RSHIFT, LCONTROL,
                RCONTROL, ALT, ALTGR, LWIN, RWIN, MENU, SCRLOCK, NUMLOCK
              Example: -s1=y,h,g,j,lcontrol -s2=8_PAD,5_PAD,4_PAD,6_PAD,RCONTROL

-scoreadr=address     where the high-score is saved for specific rom
-scoretype=type	      how the high-score is saved for specific rom
-score=highscore      default highscore on launch ("inject" with F6)
-scorefile=file	      file where the highscore is saved on exit

-savefile=file	      filename for save/load state
-vppenable						enables Videopac+ for unrecognized BIOS files
-useforen							enables "no drawing of foreground characters if VDC foreground is on"
-biosfile=file				sets the Bios to a specific file
-crc									lets you specify a CRC (in hex, without leading 0x) to use for hacks
											e.g. use "-crcA7344D1F" to use the same hacks as for Atlantis when O2EM 
											starts using any other (or a modified Atlantis) ROM
-disablebrowser				disables the file browser (if called without filename, O2EM will 
											give an error message)
-browsersortorder			sortorder in browser window, value can be either "filename" or "gamename"

-c7420								emulate C7420 Microsoft BASIC cartridge (needs the correct cartridge as file for O2EM!)
-c7420bios						filename for c7420bios (default is c7420_z80.bin in bios directory)
-c7420dir							directory for saving/loading binary files using CLOAD/CSAVE
-c7420savetext				CSAVE saves as text (defaults to save as Binarys)

-config								Use this configuration when starting O2EM (see section config file)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration file:

O2EM uses a configuration file o2emcfg.xml that keeps the names of all games as well as the
required settings/tweaks to get the game to run on O2EM. It also stores your private settings
(e.g. keyboard or joystick settings). All the command line options listed above can be used
in the configuration file. Take a look at the file and you will find 3 different important sections:

Section 1: Header and Default Configuration to use
<o2emConfig useConfig="myConfig">

This is the main header of the file which tells that it is a config for O2EM and which configuration
to use on default (optional). This part also contains Sections 2 and 3

Section 2: Individual Configurations
	<config name="myConfig">
		<option name="joyautodetect" />
		<option name="browsersortorder">gamename</option>
	</config>

This is an example configuration that specifies some of the options (as listed
above) in XML format. In this example the option for detecting the joysticks 
automatically and for changing the sortorder for the built in file browser to
sort by filename is set. It can also include a default gamerom as in this example:

	<config name="c7420" gamerom="videopac/vp_C7420.bin" />

Using this configuration when starting o2em would work like this:

o2em -config=c7420

and this would automatically load the ROM for the c7420 emulation in the folder "videopac"
(relative to the romdirectory, which is "roms/" by default)

Section 3: Game Settings
	<game crc32="0x0D2D721D" name="Trans American Rally+ (PAL)">
		<option name="g7400" />
		<option name="vppenable" />
		<option name="euro" />
		<option name="tweakedaudio" />
	</game>

In this section specific options for every game can be specified. It holds the
games rom CRC (checksum) which is used to identify the game, as well as the games
name (in this case "Trans American Rally+ (PAL)" used in the file browser.
It also contains the same kind of option lines like in Section 2, only this
time they are used when the game is loaded. In this case the BIOS of the
G7400 is used, Videopac+ is enabled, timing is set european timing (50Hz) and
the Tweak "tweakedaudio" is enabled.

You can also e.g. disable the joysticks for specific games, or set fullscreen or
do whatever else you like with it ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Controls:

    Arrow keys + L = Default joystick 1 emulation

    W,D,S,A + Space  = Default joystick 2 emulation

    F12 = Leave the emulator  (from Version 1.20 ESC only works if C7420-Emulation is not enabled)

    F1  = Pause/Information

    F2  = Save State-File

    F3  = Load State-File

    F4  = Enter debugger

    F5  = Reset emulator (same as pressing the reset-key on the O2/Videopac keyboard)
    Shift+F5 = Cold reset emulator (same as switching the power off and back on on your system)

    F6  = Inject Highscore
    
    F7  = Swap Joysticks

    F8  = Make a screen shot

		F9  = QuickLoad Basic-Program (C7420 Emulation only)
		
		F10 = QuickSave Basic-Program (C7420 Emulation only)
		
		F11 = Copy Screencontent to Clipboard (C7420 Emulation only, Windows only)
		Shift+F11 = Copy characters into keyboard buffer (C7420 Emulation only, Windows only)

    SCROLL LOCK = Enables/Disables the O2 keyboard input of the keys used by joystick emulation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File Browser:

use <arrow-up>/<arrow-down> and <page-up>/<page-down> or Joystick 1 to scroll 
<arrow-right> sorts the list by gamename
<arrow-left> sorts list by filename.
<A> to <Z> jumps directly to the first filename/gamename (depending on sort
order), pressing same letter again jumps to the next entry

on MS Windows systems use <SHIFT>+<A> to <Z> to change to a different drive

Use <Enter> or firebutton on Joystick 1 to select the game or change to the 
selected directory.

Gamenames shown are defined in o2emcfg.xml, if a name is longer than the space 
on screen, the name scrolls if the entry is selected by the cursor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debugger:

The emulator comes with a built in debugger that was used for development.
The debugger is not very polished and fairly incomplete but it can be useful
for single stepping through programs and watching their behavior.

h = display help
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
