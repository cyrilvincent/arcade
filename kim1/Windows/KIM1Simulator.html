<h2>Introduction</h2>
The KIM-1 simulator is written for my personal use to aid me in developing and testing software for the KIM-1. It is not meant to be a cycle exact complete KIM-1 emulation. Instead it shows as much as possible what is happening inside. So do not expect it to run the typical KIM games on the LED and Keypad.
Just for fun and a tribute, it looks and feels and functions as a real KIM-1. The debugger is what the purpose of this program is. The program is developed on Windows 10 (32 bit executable) and tested and compiled also on Raspberry PI Os (a Debian Linux variant and Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS. Since source is available, it will run anywhre Lazarus IDE is available.
<h3>What is simulated</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>6502 or 65C02 CPU (only documented behaviour)</li>
 	<li>KIM- LEDs and keypad</li>
 	<li>TTY in and out with TTY console</li>
 	<li>6530-002 and 6530-003 ROM</li>
 	<li>The suppress 'echo TTYecho' hardware</li>
 	<li>The TTY/LED input bit</li>
        <li>KIM-1 Tape load and save ti audio 
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
What the KIM_1 Simulator does not do as the real KIM-1:
<ul>
 	<li>Light the LED segments from the RRIOTs outputs. Instead the SCANDS routine is intercepted and the LEDs show the hex output of location F9 FA FB.The simulation is not cycle exact enough to perform the KIM-1 way of flashing the LEDs. So some First Book of KIM type programs will not work.</li>
 	<li>The TTY in and out routines are intercepted and rerouted to an ACIA emulation. See the ACIA routines.</li>
 	<li>The upper pages are not mapped to the lower pages as in most KIM-1 configurations. The vectors at FFFA etc are pointing to the KIM-1 ROM vectors, so RESET. NMI and IRQ work.</li>
 	<li>Tape hardware is not emulated.</li>
 	<li>No hardware single-step via NMI, the debugger has much better facilities for that/</li>
 	<li>The CPU runs as fast the host CPU allows, and lets the host operating system do some work like key and display and other applications running and continue the emulation loop until the user stops the 6502 CPU.
        </br> The speed is herefore dependent on the host CPU. Running the classic Clock program, showing a HHMMSS clock on the LEDs, on my Intel core I7 one minute real time has the clock  show 1 hour 37 minutes. 
         </br>     On a Raspberry PI 400 1 minute real time is 17 minutes. I suspect the CPU emulation itself is a factor faster, lighting the LEDs is quite expensive in performance.
        </br>The CPU is halted every 1000 clock ticks to let the GUI of the program a chance to handle mouse and keyboard and screen updates like the stop key. 
        </br>This works well on the Intel PC, the Raspberry is sluggish in responding to GUI events if in keypad/LED mode. 
        </br> In a future version this will be changed to either a setting or a multithreaded application.               
        </li>
 	<li>The CPU emulation may not be perfect, only valid and documented opcodes are implemented, especially ADC and SBC have many, not emulated here, undocumented issues.</li>
 	<li>IRQ handling is not present in this version, see planned enhancements. NMI key works, as does Reset.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enhancements</h3>

<ul>
 	<li>6502 or 65C02 CPU (make the choice in the <a href="#debug">Debugger</a>)</li>
 	<li>RAM to $1400</li>
 	<li>RAM from $2000 to $E000</li>
 	<li>ACIA 6850 at $1600 (equal to Corsham's I/O card)</li>
 	<li>ROM at $F000 with ACIA routines</li>
 	<li>Pages E and F are not mapped to page 0 and 1 as in most expanded KIM-1's.</li>
 	<li>LEDs and switches to the user RRIOT Port A and B</li>
 	<li>Switch between TTY and LED/keypad</li>
	<li>Emulation of the hardware echo of TTY console input, and echo suppression trick</li>
</ul>
<h3>To do, planned expansions after version 1.0</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>IRQ and 6530 timer support</li>
    <li>Testing and bugfixing</li>
 	<li>Better documentation ...</li>
</ul>
<a name="install"></a>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
<strong>Windows</strong>
</p>
<p>
Run KIM1SIMsetup.exe or place the files KIM1SIM.EXE + KIM1Simulator.html file in a folder of choice.
</br></br>For high DPI screens change the Properties of the KIM1SIM.EXE, Compatibility settings, 
</br>- Change high DPI settings, </br>
- check high DPI scaling Override, 
</br>- scaling performed by "System(enhanced)". 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Raspberry Pi OS</strong>
</p>
<p>
Execute KIM1SIM from the Raspberry Pi folder. Do not expect the simulator to be very responsive on the Raspberry Pi 4 or Pi 400. It works. 
</p>
<strong>Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS</strong>
</p>
<p>
Execute KIM1SIM from the Ubuntu folder. Works fine on a modern PC,
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Note</strong> that the font used is Courier New. Install ttf cour.ttf on Linux in .home<user>/.fonts to prevent substitution with artifacts
</p>
<p>
<strong>Other platforms</strong> 
Install Lazarus (Version 2 or higher) and build from source. 
</br>No extra packages are required, just a standard Lazarus. 
</br>Open the project KIM1SIM.LPI and do RUN - Build to get an executable.
</br></br>This works for MacOS as has been reported. Compile on an Intel Mac, runs on Intel and M1.
Note you need also KIM1Simulator.html. 
Also note you need the app (start this), the exe and the html if you move the version you can build with Lazarus. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>After installation</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Start the KIM-1 Simulator and choose Settings to 
</br> <strong>- set the default working directory</strong>. Otherwise files may appear at locations you do not want!
</br>- select the keyboard layout in the console (Geman and US International for the moment)
</p>
<a name="use"></a>
<h2>How to use as KIM-1</h2>
Start the emulator main program and push the 'Run' icon. Then press the RS key on the keyboard (or type R).
After that the LEDs awake and the keyboard is operational as a KIM-1.
<pre>  [0] to [F]  -   Sixteen keys used to define the hex code
                  of address or data

  [AD]  -   selects the address entry mode

  [DA]  -   selects the data entry mode

  [+]   -   increments the address by +1 but does
            not change the entry mode

  [PC]  -   recalls the address stored in the Program
            Counter locations (PCH, PCL) to the display

  [RS]  -   causes a total system reset and a return to
            the control of the operating program

  [GO]  -   causes program execution to begin starting
            at the address shown on the display

  [ST]  -   terminates the execution of  a program and
            causes a return to the control of the
            operating program
</pre>
Besides pressing the keys on the KIM keybaord on the screen you can also use the PC keyboard:
<pre>  0-9 : key 0 - 9
  a-f : key A - F
  A-F : key A - F
  +   : +
  &lt; : AD 
  &gt; : DA
  P,p : PC
  G,g : GO
  S,s : ST
  R,r : RS
  S,s : ST
</pre>
<a name="console"></a>
<h3> Console</h3>
<p>
Press the TTY switch and run/stop and you have a console terminal. The KIM-1 teletype commands now work and also programs line KB9 Basic can be used. See the Console chapter below.
</p>
<h3>KIM-1 Tape load and save</h3>
<p>
The KIM-1 tape load ($1873) and save ($1800) programs are emulated.
<p>
Fill in the tape ID and optionally start and end address as documented in the KIM-1 User manual.
</p>
<p>
Start the Save at $1800 and the load at $1873 with the KIM-1 monitor.
</p>
<p>
You will be prompted for file to load or save. 
</p>
<h3>Default working directory and other settings</h3>
<p>
Use the menu Settings to dipslay the possible settings that survive sessions.
</br>- Set default work folder to choose a folder for all files created or used by the emulator. The settings are saved between sessions.
</br>- Set the preferred keyboard layout (US International German,Belgium (french), others await your input, see below)
</p>
<p>
Default settings config file : "/home/(user)/.config/KIM1SIM.cfg" or C:\users\(user)\Appdata\local\KIM1SIM.cfg" 
</br>
Loaded at startup, updated via the Settings menu. 
</p>
<a name="load"></a>
<h3>Load and Save</h3>
The menu has Load and Save functions, you can load and save to many 8 bit binary formats as MOS papertape, Intel HEX, Motorola S record, binary and simple hex.
The 16 bit versions of Intel Hex etc are not supported.
</br>
The Define Type is a text file format suitable for inclusion in assembler source.
The layout is as follows (all in hex)
<pre>
; <Start address> - <end address>
        <define text> $<hex data>
		 ..
where <define text> is what you fill in the Define text entry, may be empty.

Example:
; 1800-1805
        .byte $A9
        .byte $AD
        .byte $8D
        .byte $EC
        .byte $17
        .byte $A9
</pre>


<h3>TTY console mode</h3>
Press the TTY console switch to let the KIM simulator use a glass teletype in a console window. The standard KIM user interface is shown, see the manual how to use.
<strong>Note:</strong> set the PC keyboard to CAPS Lock, only uppercase is used in the KIM monitor.
Note the menu options to record a session, (Load Text to Console) or play (Save text from Console, followed by Stop saving text ) a text file in the console.
This is in fact the same functionality as a teletype with high speed papertape punch or reader. You can use this to load and save Basic programs as ASCII text files. Or use the KIM-1 tape routines built in KB9 Basic!
<a name="console"></a>
<h2>The console</h2>
<p>
The console is an emulation video terminal (ANSI color, subset) connected to an ACIA (a Motorola 6850) in the KIM-1. The KIM Monitor is patched to send or receive via the ACIA and is transparant to the user of the KIM-1 I/O routines (even the quirlks like flags and returned register values!)

</p>
<p>
Keyboard input, when the console window has focus, is sent to the serial input of the ACIA. No local echo. The KIM-1 monitor only accepts uppercase (hint: Caps lock!), user programs are free to use upper or lowercase.
</p>
<p>
Characters sent tot to ACIA output are received by the console window and handled as a VT100 would do, a subset of the ANSI/VT100 is implemented.
All keys of the PC are usable, SHIFT works. Note the translation of codes from the PC keyboard to ASCII characters is for the keybaord choosen in Settings.
Other mappings are possible by changing the routine in console.pas: procedure TFconsole.FormKeyDown
</p>
<p>
Received characters by the console are handled as follows, a subset of the ANSI set.
</p>
<p>
Single control character

<h3>Console and the keyboard</h3>
Handling different keyboard layouts and platform independent development is a nightmare! The Console in Version 1 and below is built for the US International keyboard, the only type I use.
SInce then some more keybaord layoyts are added, you can select form the Settings. 

This means the key code translation is fine for a-z, A_Z, 0-9, with NumLock also for the numeric keyboard, backspace, delete and othr control characters. Fine for the KIM-1 monitor.
</br> The key code translation is now not optimal for keyboards with other layouts, characters like []{}\|;:'",<.>/?!@#$%~^&*()_+ are possibly mapped wrong.
</br>
This can be fixed in a newer version by letting the user select a keyboard layout. But I do not have all those keyboards and the information on the internet is confusing.
So I built a test program to let you help me: Testkeydown. Fill in the type of your keyboard, press at least the []{}\|;:'",<.>/?!@#$%~^&*()_+ keys, et Num Lock and press the numeric keyboard. 
Save to the file keydowntestfile.txt and sent it to me at h.otten (fill in here at sign) hansotten.nl so that I can add your variant to the Simulator.
<a name="debug"></a>
<h2>The debugger</h2>
From the menu Simulator choose Debugger to show the debug window. This windows has step/single step/run buttons, shows the registers and flags, zeropage, memory and the stack. The Trace logfile facility may store a trace of what happened.The disassembler part shows a disassembly.

Several refresh buttons let you update the current state of the machine.
<h3>Single step, RUN, trace log</h3>
First set the PC to the first instruction of the program to test.
<ul>
 	<li>Step in: execute next instruction</li>
 	<li>Step over: execute next instruction but skip JSR subroutines</li>
 	<li>RUN: execute at maximum speed ( wait 0) or slow (wait x seconds between steps), use the STOP button to halt execution</li>
 	<li>Step n: execute n instructions full speed</li>
 	<li>Run to: execute instructions full instructions until the breakpoint or watchpoint location is reached or STOP pressed</li>
 	<li>You can set 1o code breakpoints, 10 memory watch points and wacthpoinst on registers A,X,, Y and Stackpointer, press the Breakpoints and Watches button to show the form to fill in as desired.</li>

 	<li>Trace log on/off: first set the Trace log file directory from the file Menu, then use any Step to have every instruction logged with status in the logfile and the tracelog.Note that this slows down execution a lot and the files can become large. So clean up regularly!
The file name of the log is set to KIM1SIMtrace(datestamp).log.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Symbol table and the disassembler</h3>
The disassembler shows locations/labels in hex format. If the assembler symbol table is available (TASM can produce that as blank delimited list) you can load it and do some symbolic disassembly.
Load and show the symbol table from the menu "Symbol table". Supported  symbol table formats: TASM 32 bit and CA65 (part of CC65 suite).
<h3>RRIOT status display</h3>
From the menu Simulator choose RRIOT to show a windows with the current RRIOT status or you can enter new values for the various registers.
Press Refresh to update to the current state, it is not updated realtime.
</br>The 6530-002, responsible for the KIM-1 hardware, is decoded to the relevant in/output bits. 
</br>Note that the simulator does not perform the KIM-1 LED/key functions this way. Code for output to the LED displays is currently present but commented out in the source.
Timing limiting is essential for this to work, the simulation now runs as fast as the host CPU can deliver.
<a name="profiler"></a>
<h2>The Profiler</h2>
Available from the 'watches and breaks' form or from the Window menu

This facility keeps track (once activated with the Profiling Check box) how much an instruction is executed,
Independent of the debugger, always available.  

Use the Refresh button  to see the current state, not automatically updated so it is no a high performance hit.
Any opcode, from o to 255, is counted. The display shows the maximum 65C02 instruction set.

You can save the profiler data to a CSV file, with instruction mnemonic and number of times executed per line. 
Invalid instructions are marked as 'Unknown'.  
<a name="focal"></a>
<h2>Focal V3D from the KIM-1 Software page</h2>
Focal V3D, an interpreter modeled after the DEC PDP-8 Focal interpreter runs on the KIM-1 and on the Simulator.
This program uses a trick to suppress the echoing of charaters typed on the KIM-1 TTY hardware. And another trick to get a hash/random number.
After loading both zeropage and program code, start at $2000. But first go to sSettings and choose Focal Break testing.
Only when running Focal! Set to Normal break testing for e.g. MS Basic. This setting is not saved, and resetting the emulator makes the setting to Normal.
<a name="examples"></a>
<h2>Example programs</h2>
<p>
In the Setup archive a folder with TTY programs are collected. Note that manuals etc are on the <a href="http://retro.hansotten.nl/6502-sbc/kim-1-manuals-and-software/kim-1-software/">Retro website</a>.

<h2>Compiling and building the simulator from source</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>A modern PC and operating system. Windows 10/11 is where the software has been developed, Raspberry OS and Ubuntu and MacOS have been tested.</li>
 	<li>Development (Compile and run everywhere!) with Freepascal and Lazarus IDE, see https://www.lazarus-ide.org/
            Any Lazarus version above 2.0 will be OK.</li>
 	<li>The archive with the KIM-1 Simulator sources KIM1SIMs09.zip (or higher version).</li>
 	<li>Unpack in a folder, avoid blanks in folder and filenames</li>
 	<li>Start the IDE by clicking on KIM1SIM.lpi</li>
 	<li>Build with Run - Build</li>
 	<li>On Windows a Setup installable can be made with Inno Setup, KIM1SIM.iss and compile with Inno Studio.</li>
</ul>
<STRONG>Note</strong> that the font used is Courier New. Install ttf cour.ttf on Linux in .home/pi/.fonts to prevent substitution with artefacts
<h3>The include files with KIM ROM and 6502 code</h3>
If and when the ACIA routines and other routines in the KIM1SIM ROM are altered you need to rebuild the KIM1SIMrom.inc file.
Subfolder 'romtoconst' contains the binary of the original KIM ROMS (6530-002.bin, 6530-003.bin) and the additional ROM binary with ACIA routines (kimsimrom.bin).
The .inc files for the compilation of the KIM1SIM, to be placed in the main folder, are created with the program creatINC.exe, a console application (source included here).
Copy the the tree .inc files to the main folder and compile the KIM1SIM program again.
<pre>D:\myfiles\development\kim-1 simulator\romtoconst\creatINC.exe
kimrom002 include file created
kimrom003 include file created
kimsimrom include file created
</pre>
<h3>Folder KIM-1 assembler sources</h3>
Here you find assembler sources of various tests. Assemble with TASM, included in the folder. See TASM.HTML for information.
It is convenient to compile from an editor like Notepad++, plugin NPPEXEC
with command to create intel hex file
<pre>"D:\myfiles\development\kim-1 simulator\KIM-1 assembler sources\tasm" -65 -x3 -g0 -s $(FILE_NAME) $(NAME_PART).ihex  $(NAME_PART).lst  -s $(NAME_PART).sym
</pre>
or to create a binary file with
<pre>"D:\myfiles\development\kim-1 simulator\KIM-1 assembler sources\tasm" -65 -x3 -g3 -s $(FILE_NAME) $(NAME_PART).bin  $(NAME_PART).lst  -s $(NAME_PART).sym
</pre>
Note that also symbol files are generated which can be read in by the debugger in the KIM-1 Simulator.
<ul>
 	<li>kim1sim6502test.asm : The 65(C)02 test, a program that runs on the TTY console</li>
 	<li>kimsimrom.asm : the source of the KIM-1 Simulator ROM at $F000 with ACIA support for KIM-1 TTY in/out</li>
 	<li>Various snippets used to test the CPU emulation</li>
</ul>
<a name="k1008"></a>
<h2>MTU K-1008 Visible Memory</h2>

The MTU Visible Memory is a memory mapped video display made by MTU.

See the <a href="http://retro.hansotten.nl/6502-sbc/kim-1-manuals-and-software/kim-1-related-hardware/mtu-k-1012-k-1008/">K-1008 Manual how it works.</a>
<p>
Enabling it will display a form on which the video memory is shown (according the packing of the pixels in bytes, see the manual).
<p>
Use the Settings from to enable or disable (default) the K-1008. The base address in memory can be set to what the original board allowed with jumpers.
</p> 
<p>
The display form can be resized from 1x to 4x. Larger means a slower display, not much effort has been put in making it display fast.
</p> <p>
Note that the pixel only appears on screen when the corresponding memory location is written to by the CPU. Use Refresh in the Debugger to force the display.
<p>
Using MS Basic: the interpreter will detect the video memory as normal memory. No harm done, MS Basic does not support the K-1008. The memory test of MS Basic is visible on the K-1008 display!
</p> 
There are several ways an image can be loaded to the K-1008 video display:
<ul>
<li>Load a K-1008 formatted binary file into memory. It will show on the K-1008 display if enabled via Settings.
<li>The Refresh button in the debugger will also refresh the K-10008 display from memory</li></li>
<li>With a C header file. see below</li>
</ul>
How to make a C Header image file:
<ol>
<li>Choose a high contrast image</li>
<li>Load the image in GIMP (a freeware image procesiing app for WIndows, Linux etc)</li>
<li>Scale the image to 320x200 exactly(have the ties between the dimension windows untied)</li>
<li>Use the Treshold tool to convert to black and white, play with the settings until it looks good</li>
<li>Export to, choose the C header file format, a file</li> 
<li>This file can be loaded with the File menu entries of the KIM- Simulator main window and Debugger</li>
