1) What is it ?
---------------
Pom1 has been developed to comemorate the works of Steve Wozniak,
who set out to develop a machine that would change the world forever.
That machine has come to be known as the Apple I.

Pom1 primary emulates the 6502 microprocessor and extends it to the 
Apple I computer. It was designed as a challenging first Java programming
exercise.

CURRENT FEATURES

- Cycle exact CPU emulation with NMOS6502 Bugs
- 100% of regular opcodes
- Genuine Terminal speed (60 char/s)
- Hard/Soft Reset Behaviour
- Load/Save Memory in Raw Data and Sim6502 format
- Apple I software : The Little Tower

Included with Pom1 are several sample codes. If you are lucky,
some of them might actually work.

2) Getting Started
------------------
First you'll need a Java Runtime Environment.
The JRE is a Java Virtual Machine that known how to execute the Java ByteCode.
Sun Microsystem and IBM are providing great and free Java Runtime Environment :
http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/
http://www.java.sun.com/

If you want to develop Java Applications, choose the Java SDK instead of the 
Java JRE (the JRE is included in the SDK). Carefully read the installation 
instructions (skip this on windows) and install Java on your computer.

Then open a terminal (DOS window), go to the unzipped Pom1 directory 
(ex: c:/Pom1/) and type "java Pom1".

If you want to run The little Tower, just load the file from the Software 
directory and type in Pom1 : "300R" then return. Little Tower should start.

Have a look at the software directory with a text viewer for more information
on how to run other software.

Have Fun :-)

GO TO http://www.chez.com/apple1/ look for the documentation section and check 
the Apple I Online Manuel to learn how you can use the BIOS.

3) Known issues
---------------
Some wrong keyboard mapping on my Laptop with the
SUN Jdk (IBM Jdk works perfect !)
Bug in Window's Resizing (The Linux port works well)
The Pom1applet work sometimes, but it's very buggy.

Let me know if you found anything more bad.
