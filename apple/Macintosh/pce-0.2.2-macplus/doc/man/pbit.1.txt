NAME
       pbit - convert and modify PBIT image files


SYNOPSIS
       pbit [options] [input-file] [options] [output-file]


DESCRIPTION
       pbit(1) is used to modify and convert PBIT images files.


OPTIONS
       -c, --cylinder cyl1[-cyl2]
              Select a range of cylinders.

       -e, --edit what val
              For  all  selected tracks, set track attribute what to val.  For
              boolean attributes, a value of 0 disables the attribute and  any
              other value enables it.  Recognized attributes are:

              clock  The bit clock rate.

              data   Initialize the track using val.

              size   Set the track size in bits.

       -f, --info
              Print  information  about  the  current  image or the next image
              loaded.

       -h, --head head1[-head2]
              Select a range of heads.

       -i, --input filename
              Load an image from filename.

       -I, --input-format format
              Set the input file format to format.  Valid formats are:

              pbit   The native PBIT file format.

              tc     Transcopy dump format. Support for this format is  highly
                     experimental.

       -l, --list-short
              List  all  tracks  in  the  current  image  or in the next image
              loaded.  Using this options prints one line per track.

       -L, --list-long
              List all tracks in the  current  image  or  in  the  next  image
              loaded.

       -o, --output filename
              Set the output file name. Before exiting, the current image will
              be written to this file.

       -O, --output-format format
              Set the output file format to format. See the -I  option  for  a
              list of valid formats.

       -p, --operation name [arg...]
              Perform an operation on the current image. Valid operations are:

              auto-align-gcr
                     Automatically align Macintosh GCR tracks to the index.

              comment-add text
                     Add text to the image comment.

              comment-load filename
                     Load the image comment from file filename.

              comment-print
                     Print the current image comment.

              comment-save filename
                     Save the current image comment to filename.

              comment-set text
                     Set the image comment to text.

              decode type filename
                     Decode  the  image  and save it as a pfdc sector image to
                     filename.  Valid decode types are:

                     gcr    Apple Macintosh GCR

                     mfm    IBM MFM

              delete Delete all selected tracks.

              double-step
                     Remove odd numbered tracks.

              double-step-even
                     Remove even numbered tracks.

              encode type filename
                     Load a pfdc sector image from  filename  and  encode  it.
                     Valid encode types are:

                     gcr    Apple Macintosh GCR

                     mfm    IBM MFM

              info   Print information about the current image (same as -f).

              new    Create new tracks.

              rotate bits
                     Rotate all selected tracks left by bits bits.

              save filename
                     Save all selected tracks to filename. The contents of the
                     tracks are written sequentially to the file.

       -r, --data-rate rate
              Set the default data rate. The default is  500000.  If  rate  is
              greater than 1000 it is assumed to be in bits per second, other-
              wise it is assumed to be in kbits per seconds.

       -t, --track c h
              Select tracks. This is the same as using the -c and -h options.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose operation.

       --help Print usage information.

       --version
              Print version information.
