Ghostbusters II - Manual

ONCE UPON A TIME, FIVE YEARS AGO ...   

... Manhattan was infested with spooks and ghouls of every description.
Slime oozed and squirted from each nook and cranny of the city.  The very
atmosphere throbbed with paranormal activity.  Gozer, the destroyer of
subcreatures, and his terror dogs transformed a skyscraper into the Temple
of Zuul.  They wanted to take over the world.  So who did New Yorkers
call... ?  The Ghostbusters!  Armed with proton packs, they zapped and
toasted every ghost in town.  They even brought a giant marshmallow man to
life that helped them quell Gozer, and rescue New York and the rest of the
world from impending doom and destruction!

Five years later, the Ghostbusters have discovered a huge tunnel of slime
running through the old Van Horne pneumatic transit line underneath the
city.  This time, it's mood slime feeding off bad vibes, meanness,
rudeness, and general ill-will that permeates the city. This river of slime
is flowing directly to the Manhattan Museum of Art, resident headquarters
of Vigo, the Scourge of Carpathia.  Trapped inside a portrait, this
legendary blood-thirsty tyrant from the Middle Ages is impatiently waiting
for the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. Then he will emerge, drawing
together all the evil potency of the slime to unleash a reign of terror
upon an unsuspecting world.

So, who ya gonna call this time... ?  The Ghostbusters!  Join them in a
precarious, paranormal-filled dangle above the Van Horne tunnel on a
slime-scooping mission.  March with the Statue of Liberty down Broadway on
her way to the Museum, dodging ghosts of every description. And, if you can
make it through these ghoulish gauntlets, face Vigo in his lair and slime
him into submission and out of commission - forever.

GETTING STARTED

On both systems, plug a joystick into port 2.

C-64 SYSTEM

1. Insert the GHOSTBUSTERS II disk in the drive with the label side up.

2. Type LOAD"*",8,1 and press Return.  At any time during the game, you
   can press Q to quit.

				3

AMIGA SYSTEM

1. Turn on your computer and wait for the WORKBENCH prompt.  Note: Amiga
   1000 users should first insert their Kickstart disk (version 1.2 or
   higher) into DF0: when prompted.

2. Insert GHOSTBUSTERS II Disk A into drive DF0:.

3. If your Amiga has only 512K RAM, leave disk A in the drive and press
   the CTRL-Left Amiga-Right Amiga keys at the same time to "warm boot"
   your machine.  The game will then load as expected.

VAN HORNE

It takes slime to battle slime.  And Van Horne is where you have to go to
get it.  Your object is to make it down the shaft to the river of slime and
take a slime sample.

METHOD OF OPERATION

* Use the joystick only to control the Ghostbuster.

* Press the joystick fire button to fire whatever weapon you've
  selected in the status panel.

* Amiga version only - press ESC to quit the game.

THE SCREEN OF THE SLIME

The screen is divided into two parts.  One is the shaft down which the
Ghostbuster must negotiate to get to the slime; the other is the status
panel with the various meters and gauges that let you know what's going on
in different critical areas.

THE SHAFT

* Maneuver around the shaft by scooting up or down the cable.  The
  Ghostbuster's feet must touch the bonus items on the sides of the
  shaft in order to pick them up.

* Reassemble the slime scooper by collecting all three of its pieces
  from the sides of the shaft.

* Stock up on courage-restoring elixir hiding in the nooks and crannies
  of the shaft.

* You begin your mission armed with the proton beam and a few PKR bombs,
  but you'll need to collect the PKR bombs and shields and extra proton
  packs scattered throughout the shaft to effectively fend off the
  supernatural swarms surrounding you.

THE STATUS PANEL

* Current Weapon: Once you've collected your weapons by having the
  Ghostbuster touch them with his feet, press the space bar to cycle
  through them.  Press the joystick fire button to fire the one you
  selected.

  - Proton beam: Use the joystick to swing from side to side and press
    the fire button to fire the proton beam.

  - PKR bombs: Hold the fire button and move up or down with the
    joystick.  When you want the bomb to explode, release the fire
    button.

  - PKR shield: Press the fire button while moving the joystick up or
    down to shield yourself from ghosts and falling rocks.

* Depth meter: This number shows how far down the shaft you are.

* Cable condition: The cable is endangered by ghostly sawing hands.
  This gauge measures the amount of fraying the cable has sustained,
  and gives you an idea of how much more it will take.

* Courage indicator: The indicator shows how much strength the
  Ghostbuster has left.  The bottles of elixir you collect stave off
  panic for a while, at least.

				5

* Scoop: As you collect the parts of the scoop, it's assembled in this
  window.  When you have it all together, you'll be able to scoop up the
  slime at the bottom of the shaft -- if you make it that far.

ON BROADWAY

The Statue of Liberty and the battalion of Ghostbusters are out to make it
to the Museum of Art to stop Vigo before the New Year begins.

Miss Liberty unleashes a fire ball from her torch to shoot the ghosts out
of the sky.

Once hit, the ghosts dissolve into globs of slime which stay until a new
wave of ghosts appear.  The Ghostbusters march out into the street to mop
them up, which replenishes the slime beaker.

Libby has to cover for the stalwart lads by firing her torch - there are
pavement monsters, zombies, and flying baddies out to do them in.

And it's very important that there be a constant supply of slime:

* If the Statue of Liberty gets hit by a ghost, the slime in the beaker
  goes down.

* Libby has a limited number of shots in each fireball.  When she runs
  out, a new fireball is generated.

CONTROLLING LIBBY

Use the joystick to aim Libby's fireball-belching torch.

Toggle the space bar to make the Ghostbusters walk left and right.

Amiga version only - press ESC to quit the present game.

THE MUSEUM

The Ghostbusters are ready for the big battle with Vigo.  But, like any
battle, there are lots of parts to the campaign.  First, they have to slide
down the rope into the gallery.  Then you have to decide who will be the
first to attack Vigo.  That Ghostbuster has to slime Janosz and rescue baby
Oscar.  When Janosz is finally out of the way, Vigo appears on the scene.

CONTROLLING THE GHOSTBUSTERS

Use the joystick to control each Ghostbuster.

Press the space bar to select the Ghostbuster.

Press Return to get to the weapon screen (and space bar to return to the
museum).

Press the joystick fire button to fire the weapon.

Amiga version only - press ESC to quit the present game.

THE DESCENT INTO THE GALLERY

When the scene opens, you'll see a picture of a Ghostbuster about to come
on down, and a close-up of his hands on the rope.

To adjust the tension of his grip on the rope and determine how fast he'll
slide, move the joystick up or down.  Move it down to slide, and up to
stop.

If he comes down too fast and hits the floor, he may be temporarily
stunned, or out of commission permanently.

Down on the Floor

Once the Ghostbusters are safely down, a status screen appears, letting you
know who is on the floor and what weapon each one has.

If you want to control the first one in line (the first one down the rope),
use the joystick to move him.  Press the fire 

				7

button to have him fire his weapon - it'll be either a proton beam or a
slime blower (and that matters depending on who you're fighting).

To select another Ghostbuster, tap the space bar to cycle through the guys.
Use the joystick to control who you've selected.  You can choose another
Ghostbuster at any time during the action - he will take over while the
deactivated Ghostbuster will stay where he was, ready to be reactivated if
or when you want to do so.

To change weapons between Ghostbusters, press Return to get the weapon
select screen.  Position the pointer over a weapon and press the fire
button.  Use the joystick to move the weapon to its new position, and press
the fire button again.  Press the space bar to leave the weapon select
screen.  You can do this at any time while you're playing to give the
Ghostbuster you're controlling the best weapon for the situation.

    |____________________________________________________________|

CHANGING THE BABY

Baby Oscar lies on a pedestal in the center of the gallery.  As long as he
lies there, Vigo is entering him, so you'll want to move him to a safe
place as soon as possible.  If Vigo enters him completely (check the Oscar
meter), you lose the game.

To move Oscar, maneuver your Ghostbuster next to him and press the fire
button.  Once you've found a safe place for him, set him down by pressing
the fire button.

				8

Janosz is concerned with getting Oscar back to the pedestal, so you'll have
to keep him away from Oscar, or rescue the baby if Janosz is successful in
moving him back.  Use the slimeblower to get rid of Janosz.

VANQUISHING VIGO

Once Janosz is out of the way, Vigo himself comes out to confront you. Only
the proton beam is effective against him, so make sure whichever
Ghostbuster fighting him is properly armed.

Vigo can only be destroyed if he's caught between the cross-fire of two
proton beams.  You'll have to do some fancy maneuvering and shuffling among
your Ghostbusters to manage this.

If you do dispense with Vigo, don't sit back and wait for congratulations. 
Vigo enters Ray, and you also have to catch Ray/ Vigo between the
cross-fire of two proton beams.  Note: Use a proton beam to push Ray into
the painting.  Make sure the Ghostbuster taking on Ray/Vigo is properly
armed.
