    Floppy Image Access

Utility for accessing ST floppy image files on Atari ST and compatible
machines equipped with mass storage - hard drives, Flash card adapters 
and like.
Purpose of this is not exactly same as with program
Floppy Image Runner. This is not intended for running SW
from images, especially not for games. Of course, some SW
may work, but main goal is accessing files on images, adding,
deleting files, copy, etc.
Regular FAT12 floppy format is supported, up to 4MB capacity.

Program needs about 160KB free RAM when mounting image, 
and about 30 KB when exiting dialog. So, usable well on
512KB machines too.

Usage:
After start select target logical drive for image mounting.
It may be any of C-P, but don't try to select logical drive
on which image is, or one from which run this PRG.
When image file is selected, it will be checked and mounted.
After that you may exit util, and accessing files on image.
Of course, need to put icon of drive on Desktop. Will not
go here in that basic thing.
Can unmount image at any time later. But, because of way
how TOS handles RAM allocation, it is best to restart Atari
to perform full RAM freeing, when don't plan to use it more.

Note: this is compatible with improved FAT16 TOS 1.04 and
1.62 mods ( http://atari.8bitchip.info/tos105.html ), which 
will be available soon, after some more testing.
