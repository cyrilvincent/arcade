   pressing Fire when the weapon is held)

   The action in Double Dragon takes place in 5 different scenarios:
   the City Slum, Industrial Area, he Forest, and outside and inside the
   Boss's Hideout.



                          Attacking the enemy




   You have a vast range of fighting skills at your disposal. Individual
   attacking moves are below.

   LEFT OR RIGHT PUNCH - press fire to punch your opponent in the direction
   you are facing

   KICK - move joystick to the right and press Fire to kick forward. If can
   get very close to your opponent, you can turn the kick into a
   HAIR GRAB KICK. And you can turn a hair grab kick into a SHOULDER THROW
   by reversing joystick and pressing fire

                             Playing the Game
 



   At the bottom of the screen are shown two sectioned bar displays
   one for each player. Each bar represents one life which is used up
   as Billy takes the enemys shot. (The number of lives remaining is
   shown next to the bar.)

   At the top of the screen, beneath the scores, is a display of how
   much time you have to left to complete that level. Just like the
   Arcade, if you are still hanging around when the clock runs out,
   you lose a life. Life is tough on the street.

   Keep fighting you way to the right using whatever weapon you can
   find. Beware of allowing the bad guys to rob you of a weapon to close
   to the edge of the screen - you will not be able to pick up it again!

   If you lose all your lives, you can use up one of the five credits
   you start the game with - drop another quarter in - and continue on
   just like the Arcade. Once all your credits are gone so are you.

   Press fire to use a credit and continue on from your present position
   when you lose all you lives and are prompted to do son on the screen

   Clear out the trash on one level to move on the next. Your girl is at
   the end of level 5 - go get her! Watch for the thumb to tell you
   when you move on! If two players as a team fight through more enemys
   its gets even more interesting towards the end. Keep your wits about
   you and one eye on your partner!
