  Outrun Europa for Atari ST

This is Gamex version with
1 MB RAM min. , for hard
disk running.

By pressing M at HW detect screen may
enter machine setting if have Mega STE
TT or Falcon.
Only if you know what are doing.

I preset this to 16MHz on MSTE and
Falcon - framerate is better. But
gameplay may be too fast for some.
Then set to 8 MHz after pressing M.
On TT may set game speed after
launch.

Works on ST(E), Mega ST(E), Falcon, TT.
With PP, Hddriver, AHDI drivers.
For successful running on Falcon:
max partition size where
game is installed is 512MB.

Added unlimited continues and
unlimited time options.
