  Outrun  for Atari ST

This is Gamex version with
1 MB RAM min. , for hard
disk running.

By pressing M at HW detect screen may
enter machine setting if have Mega STE
or Falcon.
Only if you know what are doing.

I preset this to 16MHz on MSTE and
Falcon - framerate is better. But
gameplay may be too fast for some.
Then set to 8 MHz after pressing M.

Works on ST(E), Mega ST(E), TT, Falcon.
With PP, Hddriver drivers.
For successful running on Falcon:
max partition size where
game is installed is 512MB.

Added unlimited time option.

New feature:
Screenshot saving. During game press
Shift + F9, or CTRL + F9 . Current screen
will be saved with increasing filename 
000.PI1 to 999.PI1. So, in Degas format.
Saves go in DIR FILES.
It works not good when cursor is active,
so use only when no cursor - as by
play/driving self.

PP, Jan. 2011, TT update Jan. 2012.
