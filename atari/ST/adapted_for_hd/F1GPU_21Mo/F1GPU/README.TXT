     Microprose F1 GP    for Atari ST
     Ultimate release with 2 videos

HAGA version - works on all ST(E), Mega ST(E),
TT, Falcon, any TOS.  1MB RAM min .


By pressing M at HW detect screen may enter
machine setting option - only with Mega STE,
TT, Falcon.

Exit to Desktop, savestates options.
Ingame save/loads  supported.
Data goes in file GPD .

Image of your old data floppy should work too.
So, make ST image of it with params:
9 sectors/track, 2 sides, 80 tracks.
Then rename it to GPS.ST and put in 
same dir with CONV_IMG.TOS, then run it.
It will create file GPD - same content but
different track order. Then just copy or move
it to DIR FILES - will overwrite empty GPD file.
If it is not empty you may want to save it before,
so rename or move it to some DIR .

Videos:
First is 20 sec long, 25 fps, with 16 colors.
It works on all ST, STE, TT, Falcon machines
if hard disk is fast enough. On ST no sound.
Run INTRO.TOS - first video, then game's
intro self (what is on org. floppy 1, +2 part of floppy 2).
Will look better on some older monitor/TV 
- there is lot of dithering.
If you don't want video, or it works not
well, just delete or rename file SIL1992.LAV .

Second is 5 sec, 12.5 fps, high-color. Works
only on ST, STE machines, and needs 3.2 MB of free
RAM - so only 4 MB machines.
Run with GAME.TOS. After video game starts normally.
If you don't want video, or it works not
well, just delete or rename file ASO .

There is 3rd executable  INFO.TOS - with some
infos about game, saves of settings and similar.
That's what you get if boot from original
floppy #4 with game version 1.02.
