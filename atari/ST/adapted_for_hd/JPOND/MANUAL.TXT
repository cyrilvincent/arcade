The Missions 
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

James Pond has to complete twelve totally seperate ,totally different 
missions. At the start of each mission a message will scroll on screen 
telling you what you have to do. Press fire when you are ready to start.

MISSION 1 - Licence To Bubble 
~~~~~~~~~ 
There'ssix lobsters trapped in cages and six keys to free them with. Find 
a key to free each lobster before an evil diver and his partner in a 
rowing boat come to abduct the defenceless lobsters. At least four 
lobsters must be saved to complete the mission. Extra lobsters saved give 
you bonus points!

MISSION 2 - From Sellafield With Love 
~~~~~~~~~ 
A millpond is being polluted by radioactive waste canisters which have 
been dumped in it. Trapped in the pond are seven innocent little pink 
fishes who are gradually becoming mutated into nasty little fanged psyco-
fish! Find each fish and lead him to the level's entrance pipe so that he 
can escape. When a fish is touched he will follow Pond closely, however 
these fish aren't as intelligent as our hero and he must wait for them 
before he can change sections otherwise they will become lost! At least 
five fish must be saved!

MISSION 3 - A View To A Spill 
~~~~~~~~~ 
An oil platform is allowing oil to leak into the sea. Pond must blow up 
the platform by finding sticks of dynamite and dropping them at either of 
the platforms large verticle legs. The dynamite will explode ninety-nine 
seconds after the first stick is placed. Make sure you escape before the 
blast. There are seven sticks of dynamite, at least six of which must be 
used to effectively destroy the platform.

MISSION 4 - The Fish With The Golden Bar 
~~~~~~~~~ 
The wreck of a lost ship has been found! When the ship sank it had eight 
solid gold bars on board. Pond must find all of these and take them to an 
awaiting rowing boat. Be careful, the shipwreck is lodged in a deep, dark 
underwater cavern!

MISSION 5 - For Your Fins Only! 
~~~~~~~~~ 
Toxic waste canisters are lying along the mediterranean coast. There are 
nine canisters, each of which must be found, and taken to a nearby beach 
and dropped in the path of one of the local lager louts. He will walk 
into this and be knocked unconcious!

MISSION 6 - Fishmongers 
~~~~~~~~~ 
Smugglers have hidden packages of stolen contraband along the English 
south coast. Each bag of swag must be found and dropped in front of a 

hooligan who will destroy it. Beware, the smugglers will try and stop you 
and they have guard-dogs. There are ten packages, of which at least eight 
must be destroyed.

MISSION 7 - They Only Live Once 
~~~~~~~~~ 
In the frozen arctic, seals are threatened by vicious eskimo dwarves. 
There are eight seals, each one guarded by an eskimo. You must evade the 
eskimo and lead each seal to the safty of the entrance pipe ( he will 
follow you closely!). A minimum of six seals must be rescued.

MISSION 8 - Leak And Let Die 
~~~~~~~~~ 
Leaking oil tankers are being used to transpor oil. Pond must find a 
piece of sponge to plug each leak before the water becomes polluted. For 
each leak that is pouring oil into the sea, time is lost at a regular 
rate. You must patch up all the leaks in two tankers before the time 
reaches zero and the water is totally polluted.

MISSION 9 - Orchid Are Forever 
~~~~~~~~~ 
A tropical rainforest is threatened by construction workers. The only way 
that Pond can save the trees ( of which there are nine,) is to 
findspecial magic orchids which are growing under the water. You must 
plat one at the base of each of the trees. Each tree requires one orchid. 
If a tree has already been protected, Pond will not be allowed to plant 
another flower near it. No less than seven trees must be protected.

MISSION 10 - Moneyraker 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
The lost city of atlantis has been found, and priceless vases have been 
discovered lying amid the seabed ruins. You must locate the vases and 
take each one to awaiting rowing boats. Be careful not to drop the vases 
as they are extremely fragile !! Make sure you get at least seven vases.

MISSION 11 - The Mermaid Who Loved Me 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Nine mermaids are in danger from scientists who want to catch them. 
Unfortunately they are sickened by pollution in the water and are unable 
to move. Only Pond can save them! You must find each mermaid a magic comb 
which will give her the strength to follow you to the sanctuary of the 
entrance pipe. Until you have found her a comb, a mermaid will not have 
the strength to follow Pond.


MISSION 12 - Dr. Maybe 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
The scientists are after Pond himself! You must help him escape but 
before he can do so , he must find 10 pears (the favourite food of small 
orange fish such as Pond) to feed him and his family in their escape to 
freedom. Once you have found a pear, it must be deposited on the entrance 
pipe. All ten pears must be found!

James will appear out of his home pipe with a confident smile on his 
face. Little does he know what is in store for him. Use your joystick to 
move James about - pressing fire will make him blow bubbles. You must use 
the bubbles to bubble up your enemies. Burst the bubbles before the 
enemies can escape or they will get very nasty. Bonuses appear for burst 
enemies. Do not touch enemies or your fishometer energy will go down. If 
you run out of energy you will lose a life. You can also pick up an 
object, by holding fire and pushing down when standing on top of that
object.

THE CONTROL PANEL 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
The control panel shows from left to right: time remaining (this counts 
down at different speeds for each mission); number of things left to 
save/collect (in yellow) and number of things saved/collected (in 
orange); your score; your fishometer (if this runs out you lose a life) 
and the number of lives left (Pond will hold up his fingers to show you 
how many lives you have left - he gets angrier as your lives get lower).

GETTING HOME 
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Pull down on the joystick and James will go back down into his home pipe. 
James can go back home during any mission via the home pipe. When you 
come out of the pipe at the other side you will see your house (complete 
with satalite fish dish). The house is used to store objects found on 
missions . James can come back to the house at any time to retrieve an 
item to help him on any particular mission. When you approach the door it 
will open - if you go through the door a message will appear to tell you 
that you have not collected any objects yet. Once you have collected 
objects, you will be able to scroll up and down through them and select 
one.Remember that you can only carry one object at a time. you will have 
to discover what the object do. The objects to find are a Top Hat, a 
Goldfish Bowl, a Pair of Sun Glasses, a Ray Gun and Dynamite.

ABOVE WATER 
~~~~~~~~~~~ 
James Pond can jump out of the water but when he does this, his 
fishometer will start to drop. The fishometer will return back to its 
previous level when you go back in the water.

BONUS OBJECTS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Lying around the seabed you will find many bonus objects to pick up. Some 
can be used, some give you bonus points and others have to be taken 
somewhere else (these are vital to some missions - a score will appear 
when they have been dropped in the right place). Objects that bounce 
usually do things. These objects are :

BOMBS - these are bad and will start blowing up as soon as you pick them 
up. If you pick up one of these by mistake/accident it's best to start 
moving right away.

FAIRY WAND - these make you invincible for a few seconds. A magic fairy 
will dance around you while you are protected.

SKULL POTION - these are bad. All enemies on the screen will turn extra 
nasty. 

POTION BOTTLE - these kill all the baddies on the screen. 

WHISKY BOTTLE - ( marked JD ) these are bad and turn you drunk for a 
while. 

BUBBLE GUM - this will bubble all of the enemies on the screen. 

CLOCKS - these give you extra time. 

GLUE POTS - these stick you to the seabed for a few seconds but you can 
still bubble enemies.

HEART - this gives you an extra life.
Note that some objects are invisible. You will have to search extra hard 
to find these.

STARFISH 
~~~~~~~~ 
Starfish can be found bouncing around the seabed making them very hard to 
catch. What they do to you is determined by their colour. This is what 
they do:-

RED STARFISH - these give you super speed. You can collect up to seven of 
them for hyper-speed! Super speedwill last until you lose a life.

YELLOW STARFISH - these give you maximum energy. 

GREEN STARFISH - these give you bubble power. Some bubbles will float off 
and bubble up any enemies that they touch. Bubble power will last until 
you lose a life.

DARK STARFISH - these stick to you and drag you around with them for a 
few seconds.

What Do Points Make?PRIZES !! 
As a prize, for every 100,000 points you get an extra life. 


SECRET CAVERNS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
These are all over the seabed. You will have to find them by looking 
carefully. Some will be good and some will be bad, but all the time you 
are in them , your fishometer level will drop so hurry up!

On His Majesties Secret Service 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
There are many other secret things to discover in James Pond - Underwater 
Agent. So many that we don't thinkyou will ever find them all. But we 
hope you enjoy trying.

Look out for more missions for James Pond in the near future.
