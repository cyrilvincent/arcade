  Street Fighter II  for Atari ST

This is Gamex version with
2 MB RAM min. , for hard
disk running.

By pressing M at HW detect screen may
enter machine setting if have Mega STE
or Falcon.
Only if you know what are doing.

Works on ST(E), Mega ST(E), Falcon.
With PP, Hddriver, AHDI drivers.
For successful running on Falcon:
max partition size where
game is installed is 512MB.

Don't see sense for some trainer
options - use game's settings.

New feature:
Screenshot saving. During game press
* on NumPad . Current screen
will be saved with increasing filename 
000.PI1 to 999.PI1. So, in Degas format.

Included proggy for screen saving
from GXP files. Good for all GXP
savestates - so other games too.
