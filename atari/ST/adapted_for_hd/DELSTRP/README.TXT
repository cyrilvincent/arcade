     Deluxe Strip Poker    for Atari ST

HAGE version - works on all ST(E), Mega ST(E),
, any TOS.  1MB RAM min . 
For now no TT, Falcon support.
To work with 1 MB RAM need to keep clean
boot - no resident SW like ACC, AUTO run stuff.
And hard disk driver must be set for low RAM usage.
With TOS 2.06 min RAM is 2 MB - that TOS uses more
RAM than TOS 1.xx .

By pressing M at HW detect screen may enter
machine setting option - only with Mega STE.


Exit to Desktop, savestates options.
