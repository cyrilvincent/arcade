  Lemmings 2 - Tribes    for Atari ST

Works from hard disk on all ST(E), 
Mega ST(E), Falcon, TT .
with 2MB RAM min.

Game uses a lot of RAM, so on 2MB
machines must take care about 
minimazing low RAM occupation 
- clean boot and hard disk driver
with minimal cache. 

Ingame Save/Load works with floppies.
But you don't need it really - maybe only 
for loading some of your old saves.
Instead it use Gamex.
