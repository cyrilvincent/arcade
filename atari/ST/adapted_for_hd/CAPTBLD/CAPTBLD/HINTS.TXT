CAPTAIN BLOOD
=============

When you encounter a particularly friendly alien, ask it the
following question using the alien icons: CODE GG1. The alien
will then give you the co-ordinates of another alien called GG.
Go to the specified planet and you can then ask GG for the co-
ordinates of all the other aliens around by asking CODE
INFORMATION HELP. If you're met with blind ignorance then put in
the name of an alien after the HELP.
