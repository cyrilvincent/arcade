SCENARIO

Why had they given you, Simeon Kurtz the most senior operative from
Unit 6 the task of a simple maildrop in Berlin?  This was surley a
task for a junior employee who needed the experience.

However as you emerged from the basement in a seedy London backstreet,
your head pounding with pain you instinctively knew that the bad guys
had made off with the secret documents, and whats more they had taken
your Ferrari F40 as well.
You contact control... bad move as he puts the phone down.  You have
this feeling that your own guys are going to be after you.
You have only one choice, retreive the documents and deliver them as
planned, which should clear you with the department.
Fortunately you still have the tracking device homed in to the
briefcase, but the signal is growing faint.
As you walk walk round the corner, your spirits rise as you see a
motorbike standing outside a cafe....
