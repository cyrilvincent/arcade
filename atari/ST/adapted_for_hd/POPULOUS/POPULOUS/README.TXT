    Populous    for Atari ST

HAGA version - works on all ST(E), Mega ST(E),
TT, Falcon, any TOS.  1MB RAM min .

By pressing M at HW detect screen may enter
machine setting option - only with Mega STE,
TT, Falcon.

Exit to Desktop, statesaves options.
Ingame save/load goes in file POP.
It is slower and will see several
flashes during save. May use HAGA
statesaves instead - much faster.
