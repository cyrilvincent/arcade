  
   Dragon's Lair   for  Atari ST

  This is hard disk adaptation, so
may play this game/cartoon without
annoying disk swaps and noise.

  Because game is barely playable
there is unlimited lives option +
auto-play (best !  :-)  ) .

  Works on any ST(E), Falcon, TT equip-
ped with hard disk/flash card. 

  Requirements:  RAM min 1MB,
better 2MB or more - then will play
without any disk access during levels.

Hard disk driver: PP  or Hddriver
are supported.

No gamestate save/restore here -
I really don't see the point...

PP, July 2010, TT update June 2011.
