      Operation Wolf      for Atari ST

Adapted for hard disk run, Falcon .


Used tools, SW :  STX image analyser (by me),
STX to ST converter (by me), HxD - hex and file
editor (freeware) . Steem Debugger (main tool).
Modded Steem Debugger for finding stackframe
related problems. PaintShopPro for cover scan
conversion to TGA, Photochrome for converting
to PCS, own simple SW to depacking it to PCH.
Devpac 3 assembler. Total Commander. Drive
Imager for writing onto CF, SD cards and hard
disks. Video Dub for capturing and processing
video from oldies > YouTube . 
Some Html editors for WEB pages.

Deprot, fixing crash at level 6 end, etc.
Code is pretty poor, too much TOS
dependance while is placed low, +
MFP handling is bad. Crashes on
higher CPU clocks (+ gameplay is too fast),
so works not on TT.
Fixing it would require too
much time, so better play some-
thing better on TT :-)
