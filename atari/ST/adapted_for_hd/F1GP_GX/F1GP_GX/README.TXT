  Microprose Formula 1 GP   for  Atari ST


Hard disk runnable. 1MB RAM
required even with Gamex.

By pressing M at HW detect screen may
enter machine setting if have Mega STE,
TT or Falcon.
Only if you know what are doing.

Tested on Mega ST with Hddriver 7.80
and Satandisk. Mega STE with PP drivers
and 4.3GB SCSI drive & 2GB CF card.
On Falcon with 4.3GB SCSI, 4GB IDE
drives & AHDI 6.04 & Hddriver 8.23...
On TT with Hddriver and PP drivers.
With TOS 1.04, 2.06, 3.06, 4.02, 1.62 .

Works not with ICD drivers. Only
mine, AHDI and Hddriver will be
supported.

Ingame saves/loadings work
to/from hard disk.
No need for preparing data disk,
formatting. There is prepared
file GPD, what is actually image
of regular game's save data floppy.
So, instead suplied GPD file, you 
may using your old saves from
floppy. All what need is to make
it's image in ST format. Param's
are:  2 sides, 80 tracks, 9 sectors/tr.
Then rename it to GPD and replace
file in game's DIR. 
Of course may use Gamex for state
saving/restoring too.
