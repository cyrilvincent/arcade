                           GRANDE PREMIO DO BRAZIL

               AUTODROMO JOSE CARLOS PACE, INTERLAGOS, BRAZIL


LENGTH OF CIRCUIT - 2.699 Miles/4.325 Km
NUMBER OF LAPS - 71
TOTAL DISTANCE - 190.848 Miles/307.075 Km
LAP RECORD (QUALIFYING) - 1M 16.392 Seconds
LAP RECORD (RACE) - 1M 19.089 Seconds

A circuit that demands a great deal from the transmission with numerous gear
changes.  The long left hander can also make it very exausting for the
drivers who have to fight the strain on their kneck muscles.  Its important
to be quick on the two long 200mph straights, cars can be set up with very
little downforce.  However, this makes th inner sections of the track more
difficult to drive with the wheels loosing some grip and the cars feeling
jumpy and twitchy.

From the pits straight, flat out in 6th at 200mph, you sweep left and then
right for Curva1 and Curva De Sol then wind up for the long curva 2 left
hander and accelerate past reta oposta in 6th gear at 190mph.  To slight left
handers after curva 3 and storm through the forth gear feradura.  From here
you need to get into a good rhythm to take you through a series of slow
winding bend: Laranji (2nd gear, 55mph) then Prinhearinho, Bico Do Pato (2nd
gear 55mph) and finally, Merghulho.

Curva 4 taken in 2nd or 3rd gear is next, a bumpy slow left hander.  This
corner is important in that taken properly it can put you in a good position
to approach the long left hander that leaves to the pit straight
Arquibancadas.  Winding up through Subida its quite possible to line yourself
up to "get a tow", slipstream a car in front of you and overtake.

A bumpy, brusing anti-clockwise circuit where the cars run little wing and
are often struggling for grip or clipping the kerb.

From the grid, you roar towards Tamburello, a long, fast 6th geat left hander
that pushes you into speeds in excess of 170mph.  Accelerating into
Rettifiolo, the cars can reach 200mph before they brake for Tosa, an off-
camber tight left hander thats taken at 2nd in 60mph.  Here you have a good
chance of getting on the brakes late and overtaking but its not easy.  Double
back up the hill to a fast left at Piratella, flat out in 4th, then change
into 5th just as you leave the bend.

Next, down the hill into the long left hander towards the Acque Minerale
chicane.  The appoach is off-chamber and blind; you have no view of the "S"
until you are in it an 2nd at 50mph.  Here, there is a tendancy to bounce
from one side of the track to the other and many drivers spin off this
corner.

Then flat-out through the small chicane at Variante Alfa and down towards two
bumpy left handers, Rivazza, that shake the car so much you can hardly see
where you are going.

Back in 5th, you approach Bassa, a right hand chicane that leaves you a bit
blind with no idea where the apex is, then weave through Traguardo and back
into the finishing straight.

LAP RECORD (QUALIFYING) - 1M 20.344 Seconds
LAP RECORD (RACE) - 1M 24.368 Seconds


The qualifying laps for this circuit are very important because it is
practically impossible to pass anybody here unless they make a driving error
or crash.

The cars are set up for maximum downforce and suspension is a little softer
to deal with the many bumps on the course.

After the mayhem of the first bend at Sainte Devote, when the field tries to
squeeze through, you pass Roses Bar flat out in 6th at 170mph, great uphill
straight but full of dips, bumps, and manhole covers that make the car judder
and thump.

Then to Casino, hard through the left-hander and quickly right downhill, off
camber, almost brushing the barrier as the road gets narrower, slipery and
very bumpy.

Mirabeau next; a tight simple, second gear bend.  Accelerate sharply then
brake practically to a standstill for Loews.  This is a first gear, 40mph,
hairpin that needs maximum lock (many drivers increase the lock of the car
for this race).  Often, there is a procession of cars here and if your not in
the first 6 then you have to wait your turn.

Accelerate gently through Portier then flat out into the Tunnel, 3rd, 4th and
5th.  The improved lighting in the tunnel means that its not so much of a
shock coming out of the daylight but you have to be careful; the dirt, grease
and oil does not get washed away by the rain and this is not the place to
skid.

Roar out in 6th at about 175mph, stay well out to the right and line up for
the Nouvelle Chicane.  Take this fast in 4th, left-right zigzag but this
narrow section needs to be driven with utmost precision.  one touch of the
kerb and your out of the race.  Out of the chicane, flat out in 5th, the road
widens and you head for Tarbac and the Swimming Pool complex.  in 3rd, 2
esses, acceleerate briefly, brake hard and almost touch the barriers with the
right hand side of the car.  La Rescasse next, than in 2nd for Antony Noghes,
accelerate out of this bend, roar through the gears and then in 6th heading
for the finishing straight.

LAP RECORD (RACE) - 1M 22.077 Seconds

A fast circuit comprising of a succession of hard braking and accelerating.
Drivers take off downforce which make the slower sections much more difficult
and emphasis the uneven surface.

From the start, the cars proceed into the slow left/right 1st gear Island
Hairpin, taken at 45mph.  The drivers get a lot of wheelspin as they leave
this corner and build up to the long extended "s" bend which they can
approach in 5th at 160mph.  Then its flat out in 6th, 180mph to 185mph along
the back straight before slamming on the brakes for the 1st gear, 40mph Pits
Hairpin.  Its very important to get a good, fast exit out of this bend, then
right, left, through what is thought to be the most dangerous part of the
circuit with high concrete walls on either side of the track.  Past Old Pits
and into 6th gear, than accelerate through the straight at 175-185-195mph.
This is the fastest section of the track and leads to one of the least
favorite corners mong many drivers, down to 5th, 160mph, a quick right-left.
Its very easy clip the kerb and spin off here either on entry or on the apex,
but if you come out of it well, it sets you up for a charge down the
finishing straight.

A hard, bumpy circuit, which needs lots of gear changes but generally very
fast.  The cars require little downforce and becoaus of the high altitude
almost 20% of power is lost but this compensated by a reduction in drag.
Concentration is vital on this course.  Drift off-line and you find dusty
parts of the track with little grip.  Mexico can also have vicious bumps that
can cause a lot of damage to the car and knock the breath from your body.

After a long straight, the fastest on the course in 6th at 190mph, and one of
the best places to overtake, you brake hard onto the 1st corner, down to
55mph in 2nd or 3rd.  Right, left, right into the shorter straight flat out
towards a long series of bends, the Esses.  Its easier if you can get into a
rhythm because they are very similar.  When you hit the back streight in 6th
and head for Peralta, a notorious corner taken in 5th at 160mph and a
challenge to any driver, exit on a kerb than accelerate to 170mph past the
grandstand.

LAP RECORD (QUALIFYING) - 1M 14.559 Seconds
LAP RECORD (RACE) - 1M 19.168 Seconds

This new course in the World championships.  Smooth and challenging, doubling
back on itself, with fast fourth-fifth gear corners and first gear hairpins
as well a long top-speed straight, Magny-Cours has been built to appel to the
Formula One spectators and TV crews alike.  The circuit has several constant
radius corners but the cars are set up to carry less downforce.  The 5 fast
straights mean that acceleration and top speed are more important than the
fraction of a second to be gained at corners when carrying more downforce.

After the pits straight, you roar into a fast left hander which changes into
a slow left hander at Big Bend.  Taken in 4th or 5th, this propels you into a
slow left hander it Big bend then turns into a long sweeping right hander:
Estoril Bend.  Taken in 4th of 5th, this propels you into the long back
straight, past the Golf Course Bend, in top at 190mph.  after the fastest
point, brake hard for the 1st gear hairpin at Adelaide Bend and turn into the
infield part of th course.  Swing into the 2nd or 3rd gear Esse then a short
straight before Nurburring, a slight right, then a sweeping right, then a
sweeping left which turns into a double-apex 180 degree bend that throws you
into another short straight almost parallel with the previous one.

Next, a 5th gear left handler, Imola, which leads into the fast 4th gear bend
at Chateau d'Eau then another short straight, under the bridge and into the
chicane before you take a good line sharp right into the Lycee Bend, then
flat out across the finishing line.

The circuit has been altered for the 1991 Championship because it was
considered far too dangerous.  A bend such as Club corner taken in 6th at
185mph with no run off track particually hazardous.

Copse is a forth gear corner that pushes you into a fast straight leading to
Maggots, where you swing into the "S" shaped Beckets in 2nd or 3rd.  This
slows the cars down and provides a better specticle for the cars down and
provides a better spectacle for the crowd.  Then the cars roar away from
Chapel along the Hangar Straight, under the bridge, towards the double apex
right-hander Stowe; taken in 3rd of 4th at 100mph.  After the Vale complex
you have to take Club, a 3rd gearleft-hander that throws you into the Abbey
straight, a favorite overtaking stretch. In 6th, at 185mph sweep into the
Farm Straight and a fast right under Bridge towards Priory and Brooklands.
Two second or third gear left-handers followed by two right-handers ending at
Luffield, then its flat out along the fast Woodcote and through the finishing
straight.

TOTAL DISTANCE - 190.236 Miles/306.900 Km
LAP RECORD (QUALIFYING) - 1M 37.087 Seconds
LAP RECORD (RACE) - 1M 43.569 Seconds

There are 3 chicanes on the circuit, one fast and two that have to be taken
slowly.  the rest of the course is a series of streights.  This means that to
have good top speed almost all downforce is taken off, and the cars are a
horror to drive with no grip and twitchy on any bend.

From the start you take a 4th gear right hander at 140mph, then put your foot
down till you hit 6th at 200mph for the fastest part of the course.  Brake
hard for Chicane 1 which hooks sharp right and can be taken in 2nd at 50mph
but if you drive a bad line you may be forced to drop to bottom gear.  Up
through the gears again, flat out, 200mph for the sweeping right-hander then
brake again for another chicane which you take in 2nd at 50mph, come out of
that and roarinto Ostkurve, one of the fastest bends of any championship
course, take it in 6th, 200mph.  Slow down for Chicane 2, drop to 4th or 3rd,
then flat out for the rest of the straight until Agipkurve.  thisis the most
difficult part of the circuit and tends to wear out tyres prematurely.
Drivers have not built up any rhythm for the bends and all concentration is
loston the long straights.

Approaching Sachskurve, slip to 4th, line the car into the right-hander, foot
down, sweep round, then second gear to take the hairpin, speed up, line up
the car for the tight right-hander, brake lightly and roar out of Opelkurve
in 3rd towards the finishing straight.

Hockenheimring is a good overtaking circuit but the slow chicanes require
brutal braking and brakes tend to cool off on the long straights making them
less efficient.  Most drivers find it difficult to establish a satisfactory
rhythm on this course.


                            HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX

LAP RECORD (QUALIFYING) - 1M 16.147 Seconds
LAP RECORD (RACE) - 1M 21.547 Seconds

A tough but reletivly slow circuit with a large number of corners and a few
straights.  Its difficult to overtake on this course and you have to be quite
patient, waiting for the right moment.  Cars are usually set upfor more
downforce to gain the advantage of good grip on the numerous bends.

Roaring away from the start, downhill, flat out in 6th at 185mph, the pit
straight is the main overtaking point on the course.  Then through the first
of several constant radius corners at 130mph in 4th, a short back straight,
then a double-apex left-hander leading to a long sweeping right.  Accelerate
to 165mph in 5ht, sweep left then go into another double apex bend.  Slow
down for a second gear chicane, then drive hard into a whole series of fast
corners before the constant radius Pit Lane bend throws you into the long
finishing straight.

The twisting up and down nature of the track means that the average speeds
are quite low, about 105-110mph and tyres wear out quickly as the drivers
lose patience and try to exit corners faster than the tyres will allow.  Most
teams find that drivers come in for a tyre change much earlier than planned,
if only to get away from the queues that develop on this circuit.

Fast, challengoing and exilerating, Spa is a favourite among Grand Prix
drivers.  It successfully combines fast 6th and 5th gear corners with good
1st gear hairpins and 2nd gear chicanes.  Generally cars are set up with
little downforce.

frmo the start line, there is a short space of time before the cars reach the
1st gear, 45rpm La Source hairpin, the scene of many opening-lap shunts, as
26 cars brake from 160mph to 45mph while trying desperatly to overtake each
other.  Then, its a race up through the gears, downhill in 6th at 180mph, you
drop into the Eau Rouge dip, a slight left, then sweep right uphill past
Reidillon.  This is one driving line you cannot afford to get wrong, one
error and your off the circuit!

Speed up through Kemmel and into a long straight, flat out at 195mph, weave
through Les Combes and then take Melmedy in 2nd.  This is a tricky 180 degree
corner, downhill and off-chamber.  Pouhon is next; an extremely difficult
left-hander that starts off in 6th, then drops to 5th at 150mph.

through Les Fagnes and Stavelot then brake hard for the Bus Stop Chicane.
Bus Stop is the drivers least favourite corner, to be quick you have to run
over the shallow kerbs, which is always a risk.

the weather is always a big factor at Spa-Francorchamps and it is invariably
wet which results in small, hazardous steams crossing the circuit, making
driversadjust their driving line.

Monza is always full of screaming, hysterical crowds being marshmellowed by
even more hysterical officials.  The drivers absorb the atmosphere and are
spurred on to perform to their utmost, especially if they are driving an
italian car.

The cars run little wing to take advantage of the very fast start/finish
straight, Rettifilo, which is crossed at speeds inexcess of 200mph.  The
track has been modified to make it safer including the introduction of the
2nd gearVariante Goodyear, a chicane that leads into the famous 5th gear
Curva Grande.

Flat out towards Lesmos in 5th there is another 2nd gear chicane: Curva della
Roggia before the double right-hander Curva do Lesmos corner.  you take the
first part in 4th gear then power up to take the 2nd part flat out.  These
corners have to be taken just right for any slight error will slow you down
considerably and puy you in a bad position for the 180mph back straight,
Curva del Serragilo.

then its a tricky 3rd gear chicane Variante Ascari, come out of this in 5th
and change down Rettifilo Centro at 190mph in top and brake hard for the
famous Curva Parabolica, a fast, 180 degree right-hander thats taken in 4ht
at 140mph.  Accelerate to 160mph out of the bend, then storm through the
finishing line with your foot down ni 6th.

t
Estoril is a tough, tiring circuit with several long, constant radius and
some very bumpy straights.  If the car is starting from near the front of the
grid then its wise to run a lot of downforce to cope with the long bends, but
it you are starting lowdown in the order then you must use less downforce,
otherwise you'll find it very difficult to overtake.

The start/finish line is in the middle of the circuits longest straight.
cars accelerate to 190mph in 6th before Turn 1, trying to overtake eachother,
before braking into 4th gear corner.  Turn 2 is another sweeping right-
hander, then its up to 5th for the short straight, brake hard for turn 3, the
Martini Bridge Bend, a tight double-apex right-hander.  Its important to
drive a good line through the infield at estoril, avoiding the kerbs and the
sandy, greasy edges.

Turn 4 is almost a mirror image of the previous corner.  Take the left-hander
in 2nd at 45mph, then racew up through the gears, swing through the slight
right-hander, Turn 5, then flat out in 6ht at 180mph.  This is probably the
best place to overtake on the whole circuit.

Through Turn 6, a corner that begins tight then opens out, foot down for a
short straight and into the long series of fast bends, Turns 7-8-9-10.

Its important to maintain a good rhythm through these bends, keep
concentration, change up, change down, brake hard.

The final corner before the pit straight, Turn 11, is a real challenge for
any Formula One driver.  its a long, constant redius sweeping bend that you
enter in 4th and leave in 5th, accelerating all the way, ready to get in
position ot overtake.

Estoril is a circuit thats not only hard on gears and tyres but also tough on
tyres; the long sweeping bends often mean that many drivers return to the
pits earlier than planned as the heat and rough surface take their toll.

LAP RECORD (RACE) - 1M 22.837 Seconds

A new circuit that has a wide range of corners from slow, 2nd gear to fast
4th/5th gear and includes a very long 200mph overtaking straight.  In shape
it is very similar to Estroril but the surface is much smoother.  drivers
will have to compromise between downforce needed for the many bends and the
speed required for the pit straight.  Most will opt for little downforce and
try to nurse their cars through the infield section.

From the start, accelerate through the gears, flat out in 6ht heading for
Elf, a slow left hander.  if you are not in lead, this gives you a good
opportunity to overtake under braking.  then, its a slight left before a long
sweeping 4th gear right-hander that you leave in 5th and speed up for the
short straight to Repsol; a corner which turns back on itself but whose angle
progressively widens.  Next, a short burst of speed into seat, brake, drop to
2nd at 45rpm, accelerate, then slight left, slight right before taking Wurth
in 4th and roaring off to Campsa, a fast, 3rd/4th gear right-hander.

After that its right and left through Nissan and flat out, up to la Caxia.
This is another corner that starts tight and opens out.  Steer in, get on
line early and as the corner widens, move to the outside of the track.  there
is no time to put your foot down before you reach the Banc Sabadell, along
constant radius bend.

Next comes the approach to the straight.  Sweepright, foot down , then right
again take Renault in 3rd, change to 4th and charge out in 5th before hitting
6th, flat out, past the finishing line.

LAP RECORD (RACE) - 1M 43.506 Seconds

An interesting, undulating course and the only figure of eight in the Grand
Prix.  Ti\ough, 6th gear corners combine with 1st gear hairpins to make tyre
stops essential.  Little downforce is set because of the 3 long straights and
the cars generally feel sluggins in the corners.

The pits straight is a 6ht gear, 190mph charge where it is perfectly possible
to overtake, then its down to 5th for the First curve.  You drift the car to
the left side of the track, down to 4th and race out of the corner.

Next you came to a series of 4th gear bends (The S curve).  Driving as tight
a line as possible through these, you leave Dunlop Curve with your foot down
in 5th, going uphill and blind for the oncoming left-hander.  The car feels
light as you roar over the bumpy crest and come down hard for the 2 right
handers Degner Curve and Crossover.  Yuo now pass under the circuit and
approach at a slow 40mph for the 1st gear Hairpin Curve.  This corner can
play havoc with your rear tyres if you try to exit too quickly and overspin
the back wheels.  Now line up the car for the long double apex left hander.
Enter in 4th but slow down for the 2nd part of Spoon Curve for its quite easy
to spin off here.

Next you get one of the fastest straights, 6th gear, 180mph, sweeping left
with both hands on the wheel, ease your car carefully through the slow Casio
Chicane then storm through flat out past the finishing straight.

A hard, unforgetting street circuit that requires numerous gear changes and
is very tough on brakes and tyres.  The last Grand Prix venue of the
champoinship season and always very exciting as teams try to finish the year
off with a win.  Adelaide has been responsible for deciding the outcome of
several championship, the most famous being Nigel Mansells blow out in 1986.
Again, there is a need to compromise; youll need a lot of 90 degree bends but
you will also need speed of the Jones and Brabhim straights.

After the start, you come to a fast 4th gear chicane at Wakefield Road, take
this at about 140mph then flat out towards the Finders Street complex.  The
road is very bumpy here and the occasional manhole cover will knock the
breath out of you.  Brake hard for a difficult 2nd gear 90 degree right
hander then left 90 degrees and right 90 degrees.  Through East Terrace and a
fast off-camber left-hander, drop down to 2nd gear and steer a good line to
hit Jones's straight in 5th.  Foot down, then a slight right and into Brabham
straight, under the 2 bridges flat out, 200mph in 6th.

Next you step on the brakes to take the tricky 1st gear 40mph hairpin and
speed up into 3rd for a deceptive tightening corner stay wide as long as
possible hit the apex late, brake, change down, take a line on the outside
and follow the curve of the bend to give you the smoothest possible exit
angle.  Past Pits and right through Racecourse, brake hard, change down into
2nd for a good fast exit into the finishing straight.

end.
