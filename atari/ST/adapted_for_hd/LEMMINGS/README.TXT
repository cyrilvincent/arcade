 
    Lemmings    for   Atari ST


This is gamex/hard disk adaptation.
Works on all ST, STE, Mega ST, Mega STE,
Falcon with min 1MB RAM. Needs PP,
AHDI or Hddriver, partition under 512MB.

Game has extremely weird IKBD code, 
what results in problems on Falcon.
Therefore start game always from
ST medium resolution on Falcon.
Then gamex will work good.


Entering any level :  original game
asks for multiletter codes if want
to enter some higher level.
Here it is replaced with simple
entering of level number.
There is total 120 level, divided in
4 sections:  Fun, Tricky, Taxing and
Mayhem. Each section has 30 levels.
So, to enter level 28 of Taxing you
need to type in 088 - always 3 cyphers.
