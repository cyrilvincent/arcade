This dragon was made originally for a tattoo,
but when the tattoo was done I felt I wanted
to do something more with the dragon. I just
coloured it, put it in some  moody blue cave
and of course pixeled a projection of a fuji
on the wall. Then I decided to submit it for
the "20 years of Atari ST celebration compo".

Time spent: 1-2hrs of pencilling/sketching
            and about 50hrs of pixelling i'd
            calculate.

Enjoy!
