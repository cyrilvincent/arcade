  Maupiti Island    for  Atari ST

Works from hard drives on
any ST(E), Falcon, TT. 1MB RAM
min. required.

Game uses all possible timers, loads
a lot of packed data from disks. 
 Adapting it for hard disk run was pretty
hard work.
 It works well on Mega STE with 4MB RAM.
Extra speed is welcome, although I needed
special patch to set CPU back to 8 MHz
by speech synth.

Fixed graphic issues on 68030
machines.

  With 1 or 2MB expect  little
more disk accessings - but
still disk loadings self are fast.
Ingame depacking slowes
down loadings of new data.

Don't use ingame save/load - it works
not. Instead use savestate (/ on NumPad).
And of course select "no" after start, in cabin.

By pressing M at HW detect screen may
enter machine setting if have Mega STE,
TTor Falcon. 
HAGA version, so works with any
hard disk driver, 1GB Falcon parts.
