Go in front of Maguy's. Then to Marie's room.

Turn the aquarium. You will find a place to search, and discover a box that opens by a secret code: 453352, from left to right. Once opened, you will see zodiac signs that represent the code to open Juste's medallion. The code is: 154236 (1st is mostup at left, 2nd is below, little left, 3rd is mostleft one at bottom, 4th is in middle at bottom, 5th is mostright at bottom, 6th is above...). Take the stone from the aquarium.

At the saloon, take the cord at the left of the piano. Wait until 2'45 a.m. (I recommend sleeping). At about 3 a.m. you have to go to the North Beach. Search the bow net next to the rocks and you will find Juste's medallion. Open it with the second code.

Go to the coast and put the stone in the little hole, and the cord on the tree, in front of you. Now you are free until 4 p.m. !Attention!, it is necessary to be just before 4 p.m. at the well and to enter just 4 o'clock.

Inside the well, push the stone at the right of the door (the stone has a mark), and enter the passage. Once in the cave, we will name the shells to have a a short reference: With three measures of water = S3, with five measures of water = S5, with eight measures of water = S8.
Goal is to have 2-2 measures in shells which will be put on piles.
Turn S3, take S5 and put it over S3. Put S5 on the left pile. Turn S3, take S8 and put it over S3. Repeat this action two times more. Put S3 un the right pile, marked with II. Put the Juste's medallion in the ring below the piles and turn it. A secret passage will be opened.
