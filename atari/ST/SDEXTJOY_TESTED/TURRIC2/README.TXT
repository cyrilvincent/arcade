   Turrican II for Atari ST

Works from hard disk on all Atari ST(E),
Mega ST(E), Falcon, TT.
1MB RAM min needed.

New is RUNME.TOS . It is more
compatible, and should work
with any decent hard disk driver,
ICD Pro for instance, and with lot
of low RAM occupied
(max some 1600KB on Falcon)
- if have 4MB or more RAM.  Works on any
ST, STE, Mega ST(E), TT, Falcon .
(from 1GB partitions too).
Min RAM is 1MB. With more RAM little
faster loadings, but even with 1MB it
is very fast.  On TT and Falcon PMMU
is used during load for extra speed.

Exit to Desktop is by pressing * -
it will not save gamestate, and
it will be not in High RAM, so you
can not use GXUTIL for permanent
save.  Instead it, use key / during
gameplay for saving state directly
in file. Statesave file will have name
GS00.TOS   to  GS99.TOS   .
Yes, it is runnable ! Doubleclick on
it will restore your game pos in 2 secs.
Additional space of 500 bytes in statesave
file is worth of easy usage.
Name is autoincremented by saving code.
Max 100 saves may go in 1 DIR, what btw.
takes some 50MB . If there are all files
up to GS99 program will overwrite
GS00.TOS, so take care to save it or
rename before playig -  if it is some
valuable position.

Autosave by pressing Desktop Exit
key:  it is optional. Instead some config
files or asking user at every start, there 
is small file GSAU.TOS in DIR. Serves
as flag - if is present then by every
Desktop Exit snapshot file will be saved,
naming as above. If you don't want 
autosaves by Desktop Exit, just rename
or delete file GSAU.TOS  .


May add comments in statesave file -
- hold down Left Shift while starting it.
Or  just read/check - hold down Right
Shift while starting .


Added unlimited lives opt.
