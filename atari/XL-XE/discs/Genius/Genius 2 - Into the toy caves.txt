  Time expired rules:
    When time is expired, 1 life is taken and score is set back to current level entry points.
    The extra lifes catched during the level in case of time expire won't be counted at the level retry restart, 
    but still can be used during the currente level.
    This is for preventing speculations that could take place if staying always in one level making time expire to 
    gain extra point in an infinite way due to the extra life taken in target room.
    The lifes that are consumed are not restored at the level restart when time is expired.
