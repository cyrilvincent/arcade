December 2021 V1.01 Final Release.

-Final release bugfix. There are no real new features!

	-fix for princess red skin color during attract cutscene after playing level 3.

	-fix for very rare crashbug due to sprite clipping.

	-fix for "princess waiting" cutscene playing beyond level 12.

	-fix for cutscene not using the frame limiter and playing too fast on faster CPUs.

	-fix for vizier going beyond screen bound when exiting attract cutscene.

	-added cheap fx (blue player skin + inverted X directions) for original A2 screen inversion in level 9.

	-removed bad DLI Assert (Red screen of death), the game will not assert anymore but the screen will flicker if a bad DLI is encountered.

	-added final time left when finishing the game, which is useful for speedruns. Thanks to Shauing for the suggestion!

	-game clock is slightly faster.

Requirements: 

-Joystick strongly recommended ( keyboard is functional but barely supported)

-Altirra 3.90 or above.
 Atari800 4.2.0/Atari800MacX 6.0.0.

-PAL/NTSC Atari 800+incognito/600XL/800XL/1200XL/65XE/130 XE/XEGS or compatible (576NUC+/1088XEL/...) 

-128KB of RAM minimum (Rambo/U1MB/...). 
 More RAM is fine (256KB/320KB/512KB/...) but makes no difference.
 For Ultimate 1MB or Incognito BIOS, 576K CompyShop or 1088KB Rambo should be used. 
 Not compatible with AXLON 4MB which uses a different banking scheme.

-Megacart/SIC!/Atarimax compatible device for the CAR versions (AVG/Ultimate/SIC!/Side3/The!Cart/...).

-SD/DD disk drive (810/1050/XF551/IndusGT/...) for the disk versions or compatible device (SIO2SD/Fujinet(1.0,1.3,1.5)/SDrive/...). 
 The game loads at 1x SIO but HSIO can be left enabled on PBI-BIOS.
 DD media needs to be formatted with standard DD sector-interleave (like SDX or DOS XL,...)


All the above configs were tested by AtariAge members at some point.


Thanks for testing: Faicuai, Mr.Robot, Philsan & AA members.
