here is a brief list of "problematic" enterprise programs i've found so far:

# get dexter (novosoft)
# defender of the crown show (joe)
  all ram extensions must be disabled. runs only in 128k mode.

# strider-2
# enterball ('a' studio)
  lpt gets corrupted with EXOS 2.3, use EXOS 2.1 !

# mirror world ('a' studio / entersoft)
  some graphics are corrupted in disk configurations. apart from this,
  the game runs perfectly. to fix the problem, use tape configs. 

# sorcery (entersoft)
  disable all memory extensions. some versions fail to work with EXDOS.

# wizard's lair (entersoft)
  runs only on english machines, without memory extensions and EXDOS. 
  (use "original ep128 with tape" config)
