                              WHAT IS SIMULATED
                              -----------------
All features of the original handheld game, except:
1) left/right turns: not simulated due to lack of interest

                                 HOW TO PLAY
                                 -----------
* Press On/Off button to turn on/off the game.
* Press Start button to begin the game.
* Instructions:
  - Your aim is to overtake as many bikers as possible before running out of
    fuel and crashing your bike.
  - As soon as you score a fixed amount of points on the current track, a new
    track will be made available for you to race.
  - At the beginning of the track, you'll have a new bike with full fuel tank.
  - Sometimes a fuel pump or a spanner will appear on the left or right sides
    of the road. You can fill your fuel tank or restore your bike by moving
    close to them and then pressing Start to collect them.
  - When game is over you can continue the game by pressing Start before the
    "CON" writing fades (10 seconds). You'll run the same track and your score
    will be reset zero.
* Score:
  - 100 points per every overtaken bike, (slow speed)
  - 200 points per every overtaken bike, (medium speed)
  - 300 points per every overtaken bike, (fast speed)
* Maximum displayed score is 199.900 points, then score resets to 0.
