                              WHAT IS SIMULATED
                              -----------------
All features of the original handheld game, except:

                           ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
                           -----------------------
This simulator features a few peculiar routines simulating a true "artificial
intelligence". Those routines are used to move ghosts: they chase Grab Man when
in "normal" mode, or they will escape when in "Power Pill" mode!
