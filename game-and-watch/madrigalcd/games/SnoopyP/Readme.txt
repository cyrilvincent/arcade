                              -----------------
All features of the original handheld game, except:
1) time/alarm setting mode: not simulated due to lack of interest

                                 HOW TO PLAY

* Press Game A button to play game A (easy).
* Press Game B button to play game B (hard).
* Instructions:
  - Shroeder is playing his piano. The notes fly through the air to where
    Woodstock is sleeping.
  - Operate Snoopy left and right to strike down the notes with his hammer so
    that Woodstock may sleep in peace.
  - If a note gets to any nest, a miss occurs; three misses and game ends.
  - Game A: 3 lines of notes.
  - Game B: 4 lines of notes.
* Score:
  - 1 point for each note knocked down.
* At 300 points a music is played and all misses are canceled; if there are no
  misses when 300 points are reached game goes into "Chance-Time": score
  flashes and all points are awarded at double value until miss is made.
* Maximum display score is 999 points. At 999 points score resets and game
  starts again (at higher speed).
* Highest scores are saved in the System Registry.
* After game ends, time function displays after about 5 minutes.
