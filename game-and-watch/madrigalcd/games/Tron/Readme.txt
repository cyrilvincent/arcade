                              WHAT IS SIMULATED

                           ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
                           -----------------------
This simulator features a few peculiar routines to create a true "artificial
intelligence". Those routines are used in Sark's movement in the Light Cycle
Game: Sark aims to trap Tron within his Wall Bars.



                                 HOW TO PLAY
                                 -----------
* Start game by clicling on the "on/off" switch. Game starts immediately.
* Turn off game by clicking on that switch again.
* Instructions:
  - You must destroy your enemy: Sark and the MCP (Master Control Program) by
    making the Enemy Light Cycle crash and by destroying Sark's Rings and
    finally by penetrating the MCP barrier and destroying the MCP.
* Level 1: The Light Cycle Game
  - Two Light Cycles appear: Tron's (the blue one) Sark's (the red one).
  - As both Cycles travel across the screen they create a wall behind them.
  - You must try to destroy the enemy's Cycle by causing it to crash into a
    wall while avoiding crashing into a wall or the enemy Cycle.
  - Press the "Speed/Shoot" button to accelerate.
  - Score:
      5 points for moving ahead and creating five Tron wall bars.
    100 points for destroying each enemy Light Cycle.
* Level 2: The Ring Game
  - Tron is on the left and Sark is on the right.
  - The green bars beneath each figure represent the four Rings each player
    begins with.
  - Move Tron up and down to catch the Disc as Sark throws it; then position
    Tron and press the "Speed/Shoot" button to throw the Disc where Sark can't
    catch it.
  - If either one misses it they lose one Ring below them.
  - Score:
      5 points for catching a Disc.
     20 points for destroying the enemy's Ring.
    200 points for destroying all Rings.
* Level 3: the MCP Game
  - Tron is on the left on a stationary position.
  - Below him are bars that act as timers: the number of bars equals the number
    of Tron's remaining Rings from the Ring Game.
  - Press the "Speed/Shoot" button to throw one Disc at the MCP Barrier; the
    Barrier will begin to move up and down.
  - Try to pick the correct timing to press the "Speed/Shoot" button again and
    release a Disc to penetrate the Barrier and destroy the MCP; then game
    starts again with the Light Cycle Game - at higher speed!
  - If the Disc fails to penetrate the Barrier you must release another Disc
    and aim for the correct timing again.
  - If all bars below Tron disappear, a miss is scored.
  - Score:
    200 points for destroying the MCP.
    Bonus 50 points x the number or remaining timing bars.
* Score:
 - The highest score that can be recorded is 1,995 points; anything over 2,000
   points appear as a green bar on the top of the screen when your total score
   is shown.
 - The highest possible score is 15,995 points, shown as seven bars plus 1,995.
 - Bonus life is given at every 2,000 points scored (maximum five lives at one
   time).
