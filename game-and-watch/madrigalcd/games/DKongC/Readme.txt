* Press Power switch to turn on/off the game.
* Press Start/Jump button to play.

  - Move Mario to make him rescue his girlfriend, kidnapped by Donkey Kong.
  - In odd levels, Donkey Kong throws barrels at Mario. Operate Mario and take
    him to the top of the building, making him avoid barrels.
  - In even levels, operate Mario in order to remove all rivets from the
    girders by walking above them. Fireballs hang around: be sure Mario
    won't touch them!
  - Additional infos:
    don't let Mario move too left or right of the girders or he'll fall down;
    the left ladder on the second girder is a "safe position" from barrels;
    Mario can walk, not jump through the electric fence below Donkey Kong.
