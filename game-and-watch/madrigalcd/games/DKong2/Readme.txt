* Instructions:
  - A continuation of the famous Donkey Kong Story. Now Mario has chained
    Donkey Kong.
  - Donkey Kong Junior braves snapjaws, sparks and birds, throwing the key
    which will open Donkey Kong's locks, up to where his papa is held prisoner.
  - Avoid sparks overhead and make Junior jump and throw key to upper screen.
  - When a snapjaw attacks, make Junior jump without hitting overhead spark.
  - When Junior reaches the upper screen, he has to jump to get the key he
    threw again. The key jumps to one of the four locks.
  - Press top of "PLUS" button when on top of chain. A lock opens.
* Score:
  - when Junior jumps over a spark or snapjaw, score 1 point
  - when each lock is opened, points are awarded according to time from the
    start of the game, from 5 to 15 points
  - when all four locks are opened, further 20 points are awarded
* At 300 points fanfare sounds and one Junior is restored to bullpen. If there
  are no misses when 300 points are reached game goes into "Chance-Time":
  score flashes and all points are awarded at double value until miss is made.
* Maximum displayed score is 999 points.
* Highest scores are saved in the System Registry.
* After game ends, time function displays after about 5 minutes.
