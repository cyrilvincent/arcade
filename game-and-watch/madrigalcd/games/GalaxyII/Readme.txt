* Press the On/Off switch to turn on/off the game.
* Press Select button to select game difficulty (1 to 4).
* Press Start button to play.
* Instructions:
  - Game is divided into four phases.
  - In Phase 1, you must destroy a squadron of fighters that attack in two
    different patterns: a zigzag and a backward-forward motion.
  - In Phase 2, another squadron attacks, this time in a circular formation.
  - In Phase 3, the enemy command ships are vulnerable but watch out for their
    barrage of missiles!
  - In Phase 4, you are challenged to complete a difficult docking maneuver.
    Your earth ship launches a space shuttle and the countdown begins.
  - Five misses and game ends (in phases 1 to 3).
* Score:
  - In Phase 1, enemy warships on top rows are worth 10 or 20 points each.
  - In Phase 1, enemy warships moving down are worth 40 or 50 points each.
  - In Phase 2, enemy warships are worth 70 points each.
  - In Phase 3, enemy command ships are worth 100 points each.
  - In Phase 4, you score bonus points. The amount of points depend on how much
    time you spend to complete the docking maneuver.
* Maximum displayed score is 10.000.
