; MADrigal's Simulators - Configuration file 5.0
; ==============================================
; This file contains the settings and implementation of the "skins" system
; It is made of three sections, each divided into separate groups.
;
;
; First section: common settings
; ==============================
; This section contains the following settings:
;
; - size of the game background (height/width)
;
; - the path of the folder containing the game graphics as either "relative" or
;   "full" path
;   e.g. SkinDir = Graphics\Skin\ (default sub-folder)
;   e.g. SkinDir = C:\Parachut\Graphics\Skin\ (full path mode)
;
; - the configuration options for the visualisation mode, for the two available
;   options (to be selected via the on-screen game menu) - these being:
;
;   1) Shaped
;      The application window is "cut" to size to display the electronic game,
;      which is moveable (click & move) on the screen desktop.
;
;      OPTIONS
;
;      * TranspColor: can be any colour currently not utilised in the game,
;        generally magenta ($00ff00ff in 00BBGGRR format).
;
;   2) Fullscreen (default)
;      The game is displayed at the centre of the screen and an image can be
;      utilised as a "backdrop" (wallpaper) around it.
;
;      OPTIONS
;
;      * BackdropDir: is the path of the folder containing the backdrop graphics
;        (accepted formats: BMP, JPG and PNG).
;
;      * BackdropFile: is the filename of the backdrop image. This can be set
;        e.g. wallpaper1024x768.jpg) or left blank. If left blank (or file not
;        found), the screen will be filled with a solid colour.
;
;      * BackdropStretch: the image can be "centered" or "stretched" to
;        fit the screen resolution.
;        Options: 0 (default) or 1 (stretched)
;
;      * BgColor: the solid colour around an unstretched backdrop or the
;        electronic game - if no backdrop utilised.
;        The colour format is $00BBGGRR
;
;      * GameOffsetX and GameOffsetY: the electronic game can be placed centered
;        (option: "Center", default) horizontally and/or vertically, or an
;        integer number can be specified (positive or negative, e.g.
;        GameOffsetX = Center and GameOffsetY = 50).
;
;      * LogoFile: is the filename of the logo image. This can be set
;        e.g. logo400x150.png) or left blank.
;
;      * LogoPosition: the logo can be placed in any of the following locations:
;          0: top-left
;          1: top-right (default)
;          2: bottom-left
;          3: bottom-right
;
;
; Second section: game manual
; ===========================
; This section contains the following settings:
;
; - size of the game manual (height/width)
;
; - the path of the folder containing the game manual graphics as either
;   "relative" or "full" path
;   e.g. ManualDir = Graphics\Manual\ (default sub-folder)
;   e.g. ManualDir = C:\Parachut\Graphics\Manual\ (full path mode)
;
; NOTE: The manual is not included in all simulators.
;
; NOTE: The manual is made of a series of images which filenames are in the
;       format "number.bmp" (e.g. "1.bmp", "2.bmp", etc.). The number of images
;       varies with the simulator
;
;
; Third section: game graphics
; ============================
; This section is composed of dozens of "Image..." portions, each indicating:
;
; - the filename of one source image (in BMP, JPG or PNG format).
;   This can be left undefined (e.g. Filename = nil) if the image is just a
;   blank placeholder/spacer to be utilised in conjunction with a different
;   image - typically score digits and game buttons.
;
; - the size (height/width)
;
; - the position (left/top) in relation to the initial coordinate of the
;   electronic game background graphics (x=0, y=0 being the top-left corner of
;   the screen).
;
; NOTE: As a general rule:
;       JPG images are suitable for background images and buttons
;       BMP images are suitable for 8-bit sprites (background colour will be
;           treated as transparent and the image will become "shaped")
;       PNG images are suitable for buttons and sprites, and can be transparent
