                              WHAT IS SIMULATED
                              -----------------
All features of the original handheld game, except:
1) time/alarm setting mode: not simulated due to lack of interest
2) demo mode: same as above



                                 HOW TO PLAY
                                 -----------
* Press Time button to view current time (hold to view alarm time).
* Press Game A button to play game A (easy).
* Press Game B button to play game B (hard).
* Instructions:
  - Charlie Brown and Snoopy are playing tennis.
  - Snoopy has to climb the tree to receive Charlie Brown's serve.
  - Lucy keeps butting in, intercepts the ball from snoopy and returns it.
  - Pressing when ball is just in front of Snoopy's face is good timing. 
  - When Snoopy swings and misses, he can not move until his racket returns to
    original position.
 - When Snoopy misses, ball continues on, followed by sound of broken bottles.
    CRASH mark appears. Snoopy pretends innocence, fakes sleep. Charlie Brown
    throws racket down in despair.
* Score:
  - 2 points when returning Charlie Brown's ball.
  - 3 points when returning Lucy's ball.
* Bonus scores are those with 200 or 500 points (200, 500, 1200, 1500, ... to
  9500). When each bonus score is reached, fanfare sounds and all misses are
  canceled. When a bonus score is reached and there are no misses registered,
  game goes into "Chance time" for 50 to 70 seconds. Score flashes on and off,
  returning Charlie Brown's ball score 5 points, Lucy's ball score 6 points. 
* Maximum display score is 9999 points.
* After game ends, time function displays after about 5 minutes.
