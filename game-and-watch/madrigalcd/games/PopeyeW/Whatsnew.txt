24th December, 2021 - Release 1.01 (Standard 5, more accuracy)
Rewritten a big chunk of the routines that control items generation and
movement, aiming to make the simulation even more accurate. I believe it
is now extremely accurate, almost identical to the real game.

28th February, 2021 - Release 1.00 (Standard 1, final)
First stable release.
