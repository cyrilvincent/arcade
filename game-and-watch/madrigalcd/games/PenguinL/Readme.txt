                              WHAT IS SIMULATED
                              -----------------
All features of the original handheld game, except:
1) demo mode: not simulated due to lack of interest



                           ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
                           -----------------------
This simulator features a few peculiar routines to create a true "artificial
intelligence". Those routines are used in 1-player game-mode only, so give it
a try and find out how hard it is to battle (and win) against CPU!



                                 HOW TO PLAY
                                 -----------
* Press Power switch to turn on/off the game.
* Press Select button to select mode (1 or 2 players).
* If one-player mode is selected:
  - Press Penguin's Start/Attack button to play Penguin versus CPU (easy).
  - Press Seal's    Start/Attack button to play Seal versus CPU (hard).
  - Your opponent will be controlled by CPU (Artificial Intelligence).
* If two-players mode is selected:
  - Press either Penguin's or Seal's Start/Attack button to start game.
* Instructions:
  This is a real battle for survival! A penguin and a seal teams are battling to
  win some fish standing on an iceberg wall. The iceberg stands between the
  teams.
* Rules for the war:
  - A vulture throws two bombs into the battlefield.
  - You must catch bombs before they fall on the floor and explode.
  - If a team lets a bomb fall on the floor, that team will lose one point.
  - You can hold one only bomb at a time, as long as you wish.
  - Press the Start/Attack button to throw the bomb back to your opponent.
  - Both the penguin and the seal standing on the wall will return the bomb
    down as soon as they get it. They move left and right randomly.
  - If the vulture catches a flying bomb, it will throw it into the opposite
    battlefield.
  - Sometimes an ice block comes from the sea; you will collect it by catching
    it (move on it and then press the Start/Attack button) and then taking it to
    the opposite side of the battlefield.
  - By collecting three ice blocks your team will be able to reach the fish
    over the iceberg and eat some. This will cost two points to your opponent
    team.
 - If you're bombed while keeping an ice block in your hands, you'll lose it
* Aim of the game: you win the game by decreasing your opponent's score to 0.
* Score:
  - 1 point  - bombing your opponent.
  - 2 points - collecting three ice blocks.
