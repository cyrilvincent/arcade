                              WHAT IS SIMULATED
                              -----------------
All features of the original handheld game, except:
1) demo mode: not simulated due to lack of interest



                           ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
                           -----------------------
This simulator features a few peculiar routines simulating a true "artificial
intelligence". Those routines are used to move ghosts: they chase Chewy when in
"normal" mode, or they will escape when in "Power Pill" mode!



                                 HOW TO PLAY
                                 -----------

* Press Start button to play.
* Instructions: 
  - You are in a deep-sea maze. Your task is to outwit the deadly sea monsters.
    Every step you take you absorb a power atom giving you the energy to continue
    and score points.
  - Your aim is to clear the maze completely.
  - The monsters will try to protect the territory and chase you. If you are
    captured you loose a life. You have three lives.
  - If you manage to absorb a "marine energizer" you can chase and destroy the
    monsters scoring bonus points.
  - There are many power atoms, marine energizers and two bonus stars - which
    flash on and off.
  - If you manage to clear the maze, a new full maze will appear, allowing you to
    continue your greedy rampage.
  - There are two secret tunnels  in the maze. Both Chewy and the monsters can
    enter them. The tunnels are indicated by arrows on the screen.
* Score:
  -   10 points are scored each time a power atom is absorbed.
  -  200 points are scored each time a sea monster is defeated.
  - 2000 points are scored each time a bonus star is absorbed.
* Bonus life is awarded at 20000 points.
