  - Computer controls submarine attack.
  - Turn power on: single (bright red) dot appears: that's your ship.
  - Use cursor keys to steer ship within range of invisible submarine.
  - "Sonar" single beep means submarine is nearby.

  - Fire depth charge by using control key. You have 30 on board to sink as
    many submarines as you can. Sink one and computer programs another
    submarine.
  - Watch out for torpedoes (moving line of dots). If submarine sinks your
    ship, game is over.
  - Game is also over when you have no more depth charges on board.
* Score:
  - 1 to 5 points per submarine sinked (score depends on how many charges you
    shot)
* Scores over 100 will be displayed by code, I.E.:
