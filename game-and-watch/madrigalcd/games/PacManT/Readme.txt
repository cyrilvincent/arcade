                              WHAT IS SIMULATED
                              -----------------
All features of the original tabletop game.



                           ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
                           -----------------------
This simulator features a few peculiar routines simulating a true "artificial
intelligence". Those routines are used to move ghosts: they chase Pac Man when
in "normal" mode, or they will escape when in "Power Pill" mode!



                                 HOW TO PLAY
                                 -----------
* Press Ama/Pro switch to select amateur game (easy) or professional game
  (hard).
* Press On/Off switch to play.
* Instructions:
  - Do you really need instructions about the Pac Man videogame ? :-)
  - Notice: Pac Man can eat pills when walking from right to left only!
* Amateur game becomes automatically Professional game at level 4 (this means
  that there will be three ghosts in the maze instead of two).
* Score:
  - bait:         2 points.
  - power star:  50 points.
  - ghost:      100 to 400 points.
  - cherry:     100 to 400 points (depending on game stage).
* Cherries appear whenever Pac Man eats 8 pills (maximum 2 cherries per stage).
* A bonus life is awarded at 2000 points.
