NOTE
Prey's story and character are still in their infancy stages.  None of this
should be considered final product, just development info. We want to take
the step, since the game is about being hunted, of making the character a
Native American.  The character will be a successful business person or
politician, striking against the stereotypes.  While a few aspects of Native
American culture will be brought into it, it will be as part of fleshing out
the character.

STORY
You are a successful Native American, fighting for part of what were your
ancestral lands.  When the ruling goes against you, you pack up your Hummer
and head out to the wilderness to contemplate your future and hope for
guidance.  Suddenly, there is a blinding flash of light, your skin crawls
with electricity and you black out. You wake to find yourself in a hostile
alien environment. Strange creatures pour out of every crevice of the odd
alien architecture, firing weapons of incredible might.  You must find out
how to defeat them: master the alien weapons, explore the foreboding
battlefields to uncover their secrets, and discover what part you will take
in this violent new world.
