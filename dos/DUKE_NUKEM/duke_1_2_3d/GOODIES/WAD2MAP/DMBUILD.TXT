DOOM -> BUILD Notes (8/17/95):

WAD2MAP.EXE and WAD2ART.EXE programmed by Ken Silverman

Hello BUILDers:
I made a DOOM to BUILD converter.  It's not perfect, but it works pretty
darn well.  I thank Matthew S. Fell (msfell@aol.com) for providing the
unofficial DOOM spec where I got most of my information from.

There are 2 ways you can use my converter programs:

1.  Converting doom maps using DOOM ART.
         This method is useful for viewing a doom map in the BUILD editor
         or for viewing the artwork in EDITART.  Remember that if you wanted
         the game to run with doom's artwork, you may as well play the real
         doom!  (And Apogee wouldn't want that to happen!)

2.  Converting doom maps using DUKE3D ART (or your own art) & TAGS by
       	 using a script file.  To convert maps using this method, you can
       	 run WAD2MAP.EXE with the additional script filename parameter as
       	 described below.

WAD2ART:
	Command line: Wad2Art [Doom IWAD file]
		Wad2art creates all the necessary files needed to use Doom maps
	except for the map files themselves.  It will make these 3 files in
	the current directory:

	TILES000.ART - All the texture data
	PALETTE.DAT  - VGA palette, shade lookups, (*)transluscent table
	NAMES.H      - The Wad directory listed as defines, useful for editors.

	Example: C:\TEMP>wad2art c:\doom\doom.wad
	This will create TILES000.ART, PALETTE.DAT, and NAMES.H in C:\TEMP.
	Warning: NEVER RUN WAD2ART IN A DIRECTORY THAT HAS ART, PALETTE.DAT,
				or NAMES.H files that you need!

		(*) If you want to use transluscence, you will need to run
	TRANSPAL.EXE on the palette file.  It will add a 64K lookup table at
	the end of palette.dat.  If you do not do this, then transluscence
	won't work with the palette.

WAD2MAP:
     Command line: Wad2Map (PWADName) IWADName MapName (ScriptName)

     Example #1: C:\TEMP>wad2map c:\doom\doom e1m1
		The above will create E1M1.MAP with doom textures in the
		current directory.

     Example #2: C:\TEMP>wad2map c:\doom\doom e1m1 kenbuild.txt
		The above will create E1M1.MAP with converted textures/tags
		in the current directory.

     Example #3: C:\TEMP>wad2map c:\doom\mypwad c:\doom\doom e1m1
		The above will create E1M1.MAP from the PWAD with doom
		textures in the current directory.

     Example #4: C:\TEMP>wad2map c:\doom\mypwad c:\doom\doom e1m1 kenbuild.txt
		The above will create E1M1.MAP from the PWAD with converted
		textures/tags in the current directory.

     You can run WAD2MAP.EXE to convert any doom map, including maps from
                DOOM1 or DOOM2 in IWADs or PWADs.

	I included a sample script file, KENBUILD.TXT.  Try it and see how it
works with my game!  There are directions on how to use the script file in
the script file itself.

TRANSPAL.EXE:
		Command line:

		TRANSPAL [numshades][transluscence percentage][r][g][b]
			Ex #1: transpal 32 170 30 59 11
										  юддаддаддд The RGB scales are optional\n");
        Transluscence percentage is 0 for invisible and 255 for opaque.

        Use TRANSPAL.EXE to create a transluscence table to PALETTE.DAT.  Make
	sure you have PALETTE.DAT in the directory before running TRANSPAL.EXE.
	If the table does not already exist, it will add a 64K lookup table
	to the end of PALETTE.DAT.  If you do not do this, then transluscence
	won't work when you use the BUILD editor.
