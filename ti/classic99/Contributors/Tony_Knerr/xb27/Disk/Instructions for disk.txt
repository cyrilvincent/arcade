To use the XB v2.7 Suite upgrade disk image:
 
Make a real 40 track DSSD floppy disk from the 060715XB27.dsk image provided and put it
in the DSK1 drive. Do not put this disk in an 80 track drive when used with the TI disk controller,
I've taken steps to insure it will fail if you do so. (and that's just a dumb thing to do, anyway)
If you have an 80 track drive as DSK1, contact me and I will provide you with an appropriate disk
image.
 
Load the GROMLOAD program with the XB v2.7 Suite cart in the cartridge port. You can do
this 3 ways:
1. Select the TI Writer/Assembler cart (B), press 6, type 'DSK1.GROMLOAD', and
press enter. The program will load.
2. Select Extended Basic v2.7 (A), and the program will load automatically.
3. Select TI Basic (Z), type 'OLD DSK1.BASICLOAD', type 'RUN', and the program will load
automatically. The 3rd option is the most cool, as you can recover from a bricked cart
with this, thanks to Tursi and Senior Falcon with their assistance on this.
 
Now that you've got the program loaded, follow these steps to upgrade/restore your XB v2.7
Suite cartridge.
 
You'll be asked a question, press 'Y'. Type 'DSK1.060715XB27', and press enter.
Let the process complete! It will take some time. One the process has completed successfully,
press the spacebar to quit, and you'll be presented with the XB v2.7 menu. 

At this point you can check the upgrade with the cartridge verification program. Press fctn-6
from the main menu to run it. When it has completed successfully, you will see a green screen
with a success message. If you get a red screen, something is amiss, do the upgrade again
being sure to follow the directions carefully.

If the process didn't work correctly, do not despair. Use the TI Basic load option for
GROMLOAD and repeat the process until you are successful.

Press fctn-7 and you'll see the green credits screen with the dark blue edges for the updated
cartridge.
