              Booting Windows NT from an Iomega Drive

     This folder contains driver files required in order for
     Windows NT to operate correctly when booting from an Iomega
     drive, such as the Jaz drive.  To install the driver needed
     for your version of Windows NT, run the appropriate .cmd
     file from the directory that contains this Readme file:

       *  Run rboot40.cmd for Windows NT version 4.0

       *  Run rboot351.cmd for version 3.51

     For additional information on booting Windows NT from a Jaz
     disk, refer to the NTREADME.TXT file in the root directory
     of the Iomega Install diskette.
