     What You Should Install (and Why)

     Versions 4.0 and 3.51 of Windows NT are NOT plug-and-play;
     therefore, you MUST install driver software whenever you add
     a new adapter card to a computer that is using one of these
     versions of Windows NT.  You must also install driver
     software for Iomega drives that use the IDE or parallel port
     interfaces.  (This includes the ATAPI, IDE, and parallel
     port Zip drives and Jaz Traveller.)  After the necessary
     driver software in installed, you also need to install
     ToolsNT software to support all features of your Iomega
     drive.

     installed, Windows NT may not recognize your Iomega drive,
     or your drive may not operate correctly.

     is complicated by different installation procedures for
     different versions of Windows NT and by
