     Section 1
     What is Guest?
     
     Guest is a portable driver program that lets you use an
     external Zip or Jaz drive on a computer without having to
     permanently install the Iomega driver or Tools software. 
     There are versions of Guest for both Macintosh and PC
     systems.  Guest for IBM-compatible PC's running Windows 3.1
     and/or DOS is described here.  If you want to use your drive
     on a PC running Windows 95 or on a Macintosh, refer to the
     section on "Using Guest on Other Systems" later in this
     file.

     When you run GUEST.EXE, the Guest driver loads into the
     computer's memory and stays there until the computer is
     rebooted.  While Guest is in memory, it tells the computer
     how to talk to your drive and provides the drive with a
     drive letter.  Guest allows you to read files from and write
     files to your Zip or Jaz disks.

     NOTE:  When you install Tools software under Windows 3.1, it
     installs the Guest driver program in the computer's
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that Guest loads each time the computer
     boots.  For more information, refer to Section 7, "Using
     Guest as a Permanent Driver."

     
     
     _________________________________________________________
     Section 2
     System Requirements for Guest

     To run GUEST.EXE, you need a compatible version of DOS
     and/or Windows.
  
       *  Compatible versions of DOS include MS-DOS version 5.0
          or higher, and PC-DOS version 6.0 or higher.  To check
          your version of DOS, use the DOS VER command.

        * Compatible versions of Windows include Windows 3.1 or
          3.11, and Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or 3.11.

     The drive you want Guest to support must be connected to the
     computer before Guest is loaded.
     


     _________________________________________________________
     Section 3
     How to Load Guest
     
     Use the following procedure to load Guest:

      1.  Connect your drive to the computer according to the
          instructions in the drive's Installation Guide.

      2.  Insert the "Install" floppy diskette for Windows/DOS
          into the computer's floppy drive.

      3.  If you are using Windows, you MUST exit Windows before
          loading Guest.  Select Exit from the Program Manager's
          File menu, and click on OK to end the Windows session.

      4.  At the DOS prompt, type either "a:Guest" (if the
          "Install" floppy is in drive a:), or "b:Guest" (if the
          "Install" floppy is in drive b:), then press the Enter
          key.  If you use Windows, you can restart Windows after
          Guest loads.

     If you encounter any problems, refer to Solving Problems in
     this help file.

     Section 4.1
     Loading Guest into Upper Memory
     
     Guest can be loaded into upper memory using the DOS LOADHIGH
     command, provided an expanded memory manager (such as
     EMM386, QEMM, BLUEMAX, or 386MAX) is loaded on the computer. 
     Refer to your DOS User's Guide for detailed information on
     using the LOADHIGH command.
     
     
     ______________________________
     Section 4.2
     Express Loading Guest
     
     Each time the Guest driver loads, it must also load an ASPI
     manager so that it can communicate with your Zip or Jaz
     drive through the computer's SCSI host adapter.  To provide
     Guest with the flexibility to use a variety of host
     adapters, the Windows/DOS "Install" diskette that came with
     your drive includes ASPI managers for all current Iomega
     adapters.  As Guest loads, it tries to load each ASPI
     manager in turn until it finds one that allows it to talk to
     your drive.

     Guest can load much more quickly if it does not have to use
     this trial-and-error process to find the correct ASPI
     manager.  If you use Guest routinely with one or two
     specific host adapters, you may want to edit the GUEST.INI
     file and remark-out the ASPI managers you do not need.  Then
     Guest will try to load only the ASPI managers for the
     adapters you normally use.

     Use the following procedure to customize your GUEST.INI
     file:

     Step 1:  Copy all files on the "Install" diskette for
     Windows/DOS to another disk.

     The "Install" diskette is permanently write-protected, so in
     order to edit the GUEST.INI file and use the new file to run
     the Guest program, you must copy the files to another disk. 
     You can copy the files to another floppy diskette or to the
     hard disk on the computer where you will be using the Guest
     program.  If you need instructions on copying files, refer
     to the documentation that came with your Windows or DOS
     programs.

     Step 2:  Locate the GUEST.INI file on your copy of the
     "Install" diskette and open it using a text editor. The
     GUEST.INI file is a text file, so you can use the Notepad in
     Windows, the DOS EDIT program, or any other ASCII text
     editor to edit it.

     Step 3:  Identify the ASPI manager line Guest needs to load
     to support your drive.

     For example, if you routinely use Guest when your drive is
     connected to an Iomega PC1616 adapter, the Guest program
     needs to load the line that reads "ASPI=ASPI1616.SYS".  Use
     the following table to help you identify the ASPI manager
     line you need to load:

        Iomega Adapter                       ASPI Manager

        Jaz jet PCI (PC/Mac model)           ADVASPI.SYS
        Jaz jet (PC-only model)              ASPI8DOS.SYS
        Jaz jet ISA                          ASPIPC16.SYS
        Jaz Traveller                        ASPIPPM1.SYS*
        Parallel Port Zip drive              ASPIPPM1.SYS*
        Zip zoom SCSI Accelerator            ASPIPC16.SYS
        Zip Card PCMCIA SCSI adapter         ASPIPC16.SYS
        Zip IDE drive                        ASPIIDE.SYS
        PC1616 adapter                       ASPI1616.SYS
        PC1600 adapter                       ASPIPC16.SYS

          *Some hardware uses ASPIPPM2.SYS rather than
          ASPIPPM1.SYS.

     Step 4:  Remark out each ASPI manager line you do NOT need
     to load by inserting "rem " at the start of the line.

     For the example where Guest is routinely used when the Zip
     or Jaz drive is connected to an Iomega PC1616 adapter, you
     would remark out all ASPI manager lines except the
     ASPI1616.SYS line:

          rem ASPI=ASPIIDE.SYS /INFO /SCAN
          rem ASPI=ASPIPPM1.SYS /INFO FILE=NIBBLE.ILM SPEED= 1
          rem ASPI=ASPIPPM2.SYS /INFO FILE=NIBBLE2.ILM SPEED= 1
          rem ASPI=ASPI8DOS.SYS /D
          rem ASPI=ADVASPI.SYS
          rem ASPI=ASPIPC16.SYS /SCAN /INFO
          ASPI=ASPI1616.SYS /SCAN /INFO

     Step 5:  Save the changes to the GUEST.INI file and exit the
     text editor.

     If you are using an editor that has a variety of file
     formats, be sure to save the GUEST.INI file as ASCII text or
     DOS text.

     NOTE:  If you later need to use an ASPI manager which has
     been remarked out, simply edit GUEST.INI again and remove
     the "rem " at the start of the ASPI manager line, or use the
     original "Install" floppy diskette to run Guest.

     ASPI Manager Reference:  Detailed reference information on
     the ASPI managers used by the Guest driver is located in the
     electronic "Installation Manual" (MANUAL.EXE).  You can
     access the manual from the "Install" diskette for
     Windows/DOS by going to the DOS prompt and typing:

               A: <Enter>
               MANUAL <Enter>

     
          
     ______________________________
     Section 4.3
     Assigning Specific Drive Letters with GUEST.EXE.

     GUEST.EXE allows you to specify what drive letter you want
     assigned to your drive.  You may want to use this feature if
     you are running applications from your Zip or Jaz drive, or
     if you use your drive as a portable device on other
     computers and you want to maintain the same drive letter as
     you use on your own machine.

     To tell GUEST.EXE which drive letter to use, add the
     following option to the GUEST.EXE command line:

        letter=[the first drive letter you want Guest to use]

     For example, the following command line would tell Guest to
     assign "g:" to the first drive it finds to support:

               guest letter=g

     If you have more that one drive supported by GUEST.EXE, each
     additional drive would receive a drive letter following G in
     alphabetical order.  (When supporting more than one drive,
     GUEST.EXE assigns drive letters in order of SCSI ID number
     from lowest to highest.)

     NOTES:

     The Letter option can be used when running GUEST.EXE from a
     floppy diskette, or it can be added to the GUEST.EXE command
     line in the computer's AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  (See Section 7,
     "Using Guest as a Permanent Driver" for information on
     installing GUEST.EXE in the AUTOEXEC.BAT.)

     When using the Letter option, there must be a LASTDRIVE
     statement in the computer's CONFIG.SYS file that specifies a
     letter later in the alphabet than that used with the Letter
     option.  If GUEST.EXE is supporting more than one drive, the
     LASTDRIVE statement must provide enough drive letters for
     all supported drives.  If you need detailed instructions on
     adding a LASTDRIVE statement to CONFIG.SYS, refer to the
     information in Section 5.3, "No drive letter available for
     the drive."

     Solving Problems that may occur when using Guest

     
     _____________________________
     Section 5.1
     Guest does not assign a drive letter to your drive
     
     If you run the Guest program and it informs you that no
     drives were found, or if Guest tells you that no drive
     letters were added, and yet you cannot access your drive,
     there is probably a hardware installation problem that is
     preventing Guest from locating your Zip or Jaz drive.  Refer
     to the printed User's Guide that shipped with your drive for
     hardware installation troubleshooting information.

     
     _____________________________
     Section 5.2
     Computer hangs when you run Guest

     If the computer hangs when you run Guest, edit the GUEST.INI
     file and remove (rem) all ASPI managers except the one you
     need to load.  If you are using a non-Iomega adapter and
     Guest hangs, rem all of the ASPI managers in the GUEST.INI
     file and make sure the ASPI manager for the non-Iomega
     adapter is correctly installed in the computer's CONFIG.SYS
     file.  For detailed instructions on editing GUEST.INI to rem
     ASPI managers, refer to the instructions in Section 4.2,
     "Express Loading Guest."

     

     _______________________________
     Section 5.3
     Duplicate drive letters
     
     If you see two drive letters for a single drive on your
     system after running GUEST.EXE, reboot the computer
     immediately.  Using your drive when it is assigned duplicate
     drive letters can result in data loss.  
     
     After the computer reboots, do not load GUEST.EXE.  You do
     not need to use Guest  to access the drive on this system
     because the drive is already being assigned a drive letter.

     NOTE: It is recommended that you always use an Iomega driver
     (either GUEST.EXE or SCSIDRVR.SYS) to support your Zip or
     Jaz drive.  If you see two drive letters after running
     GUEST.EXE, check your system to make sure a non-Iomega
     driver is not supporting your Iomega drive.  Note that if
     the drive is under BIOS control (either adapter or computer
     BIOS), disk removability will not be supported.

     
     ______________________________
     Section 5.4
     No drive letter available for the drive
     
     If all drive letters available for physical drives are in
     use on the system, GUEST.EXE will be unable to assign a
     drive letter to the drive you want to support.  Use the DOS
     LASTDRIVE command in the computer's CONFIG.SYS file to
     increase the number of physical drive letters.  For example,
     adding the statement LASTDRIVE=m to CONFIG.SYS will provide
     drive letters for ten additional drives after drive C:.  The
     following procedure provides detailed instructions for
     editing the CONFIG.SYS file. 

     Step 1:  Use a text editor to open the CONFIG.SYS file.

     You can use the Notepad in Windows, the DOS EDIT program, or
     any other ASCII text editor.  The CONFIG.SYS file is a text
     file located in the root directory on the computer's boot
     drive (C:).

     Step 2:  Add the following line to the end of the CONFIG.SYS
     file.

               LASTDRIVE=m 

     This will provide ten additional drive letters for any new
     drives you want to add to your system, including your Zip or
     Jaz drive.  If you do not need all of the drive letters
     between d: and m: for physical drives, you can use a letter
     earlier in the alphabet in place of the letter m; however,
     make sure you provide enough drive letters after e: to
     accommodate the drive you are using with Guest and any other
     drives you may add to your system.  If your CONFIG.SYS file
     already has a LASTDRIVE line, change the last drive letter
     to one further down the alphabet.  Do not set the last drive
     letter to a letter late in the alphabet, such as X, Y, or Z,
     as this will use extra memory and prevent access to network
     drives assigned these letters on your system.

     Step 3:  Save the changes to the CONFIG.SYS file and exit
     the text editor.

     If you are using an editor that has a variety of file
     formats, be sure to save as ASCII text or DOS text.

     Step 4:  Reboot the computer, and load GUEST.EXE after the
     computer boots. 

     Network Users:  You may have to relocate your network drive
     letter.  

     Ask your network administrator for help, or refer to the
     following instructions:

     Your first network drive letter will be the letter following
     the one used in the LASTDRIVE statement in your CONFIG.SYS
     file.  For example, if you used LASTDRIVE=m, the first
     network drive letter will be N.

     If your network drive letter has changed, applications you
     are running from the network (such as Windows or other
     applications that reference specific drive letters) may fail
     to work correctly unless they are reinstalled or adjusted
     for the drive letter change.  If you use a batch file to
     connect to the network, it will need to be adjusted to the
     new drive letter.  Your network login script may need to be
     revised if it refers to a specific drive letter for your
     network drive.

     Check the following:

       *  Edit the Path statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to
          correctly reference your new network drive letter.
 
       *  Edit any batch files which load shells or applications
          from a network (including AUTOEXEC.BAT) to correctly
          reference new drive letter assignments.
 
       *  Edit your Windows "INI" files and your Windows groups
          to correctly reference your new drive letters.
 
       *  Check other application setup files.  Rerun the setup
          if drive letters cannot be edited.
 
       *  Check your user login script for references to specific
          network drive letters.  
 
     Reboot your computer and check your applications. 
     Applications that do not work with the new drive letter may
     need to be reinstalled.
     
     
     _____________________________
     Section 5.5
     Using Guest with non-Iomega ASPI managers

     The Guest driver utilizes ASPI managers to communicate with
     drives connected through a SCSI host adapter, so the
     "Install" diskette for Windows/DOS includes ASPI managers
     for current Iomega adapters.  If you are using a non-Iomega
     host adapter and ASPI manager software, make sure the ASPI
     manager is correctly loaded in the computer's CONFIG.SYS
     file.  This will enable GUEST.EXE to locate any Iomega
     drives connected to the adapter.  If you need instructions
     on installing the ASPI manager software in CONFIG.SYS, refer
     to the documentation that came with the adapter.

     NOTE:  If the adapter does not have an ASPI manager, Guest
     will not be able to operate.


     _____________________________
     Section 5.6
     Drive C: no longer accessible

     If you are booting from an Iomega PC1600 or Adaptec adapter,
     the ASPI manager for the adapter must be installed in the
     computer's CONFIG.SYS file before GUEST.EXE is run.  If the
     ASPI manager is not installed in CONFIG.SYS when GUEST.EXE
     is run, Guest will load the ASPI manager via the GUEST.INI
     file, which will cause drive C: to no longer be accessible.  

     NOTE:  The ASPI manager for the bootable adapter must be
     loaded before any other ASPI managers in the CONFIG.SYS
     file.  If you need information on installing Iomega ASPI
     managers, refer to the electronic "Installation Manual"
     (MANUAL.EXE).  You can access the manual from the "Install"
     diskette for Windows/DOS by typing:

               A: <Enter>
               MANUAL <Enter>

     
     _________________________________________________________
     Section 6
     Required Files for Using Guest
     
     All of the files needed to load Guest are present on the
     "Install" floppy diskette for Windows/DOS.  If you create
     additional disks for loading Guest, make sure you include
     the following files:

          GUEST.EXE
          GUEST.INI
          ASPIPPM1.SYS
          ASPIPPM2.SYS
          ASPIIDE.SYS
          ASPI8DOS.SYS
          ADVASPI.SYS
          ASPIPC16.SYS
          ASPI1616.SYS
          NIBBLE.ILM (Required for ASPIPPM1.SYS)
          NIBBLE2.ILM (Required for ASPIPPM2.SYS)

     Refer to Section 4.2, "Express Loading Guest," for
     instructions on customizing the GUEST.INI file to minimize
     the time it takes to load Guest.
     

     
     _________________________________________________________
     Section 7
     Using Guest as a Permanent Driver

     The Guest program, GUEST.EXE, is also the permanent driver
     program for your Zip or Jaz drive under Windows 3.1.  If you
     install Tools software under Windows 3.1 using the SETUP.EXE
     program, it automatically installs GUEST.EXE in the
     computer's AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This causes GUEST.EXE to run
     each time the computer boots.  If Guest can locate a Zip or
     Jaz drive (or other supported drive), it loads into the
     computer's memory and assigns your drive a drive letter.  If
     Guest cannot locate a supported drive, it does not load.

     If you use the Guest program frequently on a particular
     computer, you may want to install GUEST.EXE as a permanent
     driver on that computer.  If Windows is installed on the
     computer, the easiest way to permanently install Guest is by
     using the Setup program on the "Install" floppy diskette for
     Windows/DOS.  If desired, you can select to install only the
     driver.

     To run the SETUP.EXE program, insert the Windows/DOS Install
     diskette into the computer's floppy drive.  Load Windows and
     choose Run from the Program Manager's File menu.  In the
     Command Line box, type either a:setup (if the Install
     diskette is in drive a:), or b:setup (if the Install
     diskette is in drive b:), then click on OK or press the
     Enter key.

     If the computer does not have Windows, you can manually
     install GUEST.EXE as the permanent driver in the computer's
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  For a detailed manual installation
     procedure, refer to MANUAL.EXE located on your "Install"
     floppy diskette.


     _________________________________________________________
     Section 8
     Using Guest on Other Systems

     In addition to Guest for Windows 3.1/DOS, there are versions
     of Guest for Windows 95 and for Macintosh.  Use these other
     versions of Guest if you ever need to use your Zip or Jaz
     drive temporarily on one of these systems.

     Windows NT Users:  There is not currently a version of Guest
     for Windows NT because Windows NT does not yet support plug-
     and-play.  When connecting a Zip or Jaz drive to a Windows
     NT system, refer to the adapter installation instructions in
     the NTReadme.txt file on the Windows NT Install diskette
     that came with your drive.


     To use your drive on a PC running Windows 95:
     Connect your drive and use the Guest95 program which is
     included on the Windows/DOS "Install" floppy diskette:

      1.  Insert the Windows/DOS "Install" diskette that came
          with your Zip or Jaz drive into the computer's floppy
          drive.

      2.  Open My Computer and double click on the floppy drive
          icon.

      3.  Double click on the icon for Guest95.

     Refer to "Help for Guest95" on the Windows/DOS "Install"
     diskette for additional information.


     To use your drive on a Macintosh:
     You can load the Iomega Driver temporarily from any Zip or
     Jaz disk that is formatted for Macintosh:

      1.  Shut down the Macintosh and connect your Zip or Jaz
          drive.

      2.  Turn on power to your drive and insert a Mac-formatted
          disk.  (This procedure will work only if you use a Zip
          or Jaz disk that is formatted for Macintosh.)
