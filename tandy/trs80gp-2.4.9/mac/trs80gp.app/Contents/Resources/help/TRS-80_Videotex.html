<H3><A NAME="videotex">TRS-80 Videotex</H3>

The TRS-80 Videotex terminal was an early foray into online information
access.  It had a 300 baud modem allowing it 
to get the latest news and information.
The built-in software is very minimal and trs80gp itself hasn't been
polished enough yet to help round off the rough edges.

<P>
The Videotex could run in offline mode.  It lets you enter pages of text
and it was possible to later upload that data to an online service.
To experience this, run <TT>trs80gp -mv</TT> or use
File &rarr; Change Model &rarr; Videotex.  Press almost any key
(except backspace) and you'll be entering text in the offline mode.
Take time to be amazed that it word-wraps text as you type.

<P>
If you press backspace (which is a physical mapping of the BREAK key;
sorry about that) it will then prompt you with "PLACE CALL".  On the
real machine you'd pick up your phone, dial the information service.
When in answered you'd put the phone down and press ENTER to let it
know you're connected.  

<P>
When you hung up the phone (or the server hung up) the terminal will
print <TT>OFF LINE</TT> indicating this.  There was also an LED, I gather.
There must be some way to proceed from this point but either I don't
know what it is or trs80gp doesn't quite emulate it yet.  You can reset
the emulator if necessary.

<PP>
You can use another terminal to act as the online service.  See the
<A HREF="Serial_(RS-232)_Ports.html#serial">Serial</A> section for general information on how
to virtually hook up two trs80gp emulators.  Here's a quick rundown
of how to see it in action.

<OL>
<LI>Start a Videotex with a DT-1 attached: <TT>trs80gp -mv -r :dt1</TT>
(or select "DT-1 Data Terminal" from the dropdown in the Serial port
dialog box).
<LI>Press backspace on the Videotex to see the "PLACE CALL" prompt.
<LI>Wait a second or two.
<LI>Press Enter on the Videotex.
<LI>Typing in the Videotex should now cause characters to appear on
the DT-1 side and vice-versa.
<LI>Not really a step, but you can use paste on either one as another
way to enter text.
<LI>Close the DT-1 window and see the Videotex say "OFF LINE".
</OL>

You may find the 
<A HREF="https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Documents/Manuals/Hardware/#U">
Videotex manual and technical documentation</A> helpful.  It does support
a monochrome 128 x 96 graphics mode.  And there was even a way to download
6809 code.  At which point the built-in 6809 debugger may see some use.
