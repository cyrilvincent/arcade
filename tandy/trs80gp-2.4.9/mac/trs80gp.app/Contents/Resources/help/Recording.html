The screen display and sound of the emulator can be written to a file
using the Record &rarr; Flash Video and Record &rarr; Video menus the start
and stop recording.  The window title will flash either <TT>*flv*</TT>
or <TT>*avi*</TT> to remind that that recording is in progress.  The
"Flash Video" option is recommended as the resulting file size is <B>much</B>
smaller than "Video"'s uncompressed <TT>.AVI</TT> output.

<P>
Use Record &rarr; Animated GIF to start and stop recording of the screen in
animated GIF format.  The window title will flash <TT>*gif*</TT> to let
you know GIF recording is in progress.  The resulting files are large and
not exactly the same frame rate as the TRS-80.

<P>
For a screen shot you can use Edit &rarr; Copy which copies ASCII text,
Unicode and bitmap versions of the screen to the clipboard.
Or use the <TT>Ctrl-Alt-C</TT> and <TT>Ctrl-Insert</TT> keyboard shortcuts.
You can then paste it in Notepad or Paint (or pretty much anything else).

<P>
There is also Record &rarr; Screenshot to save the screen display as a GIF
image (shortcut: <TT>F11</TT>).  Record &rarr; Cleanshot or <TT>Shift-F11</TT>
will save a clean screenshot (or "cleanshot") that does not have the beam
drop-outs as normally appeared on the Model I and Model III.

<P>
Audio output can be captured in <TT>.WAV</TT> format using Record &rarr; Audio
with <TT>*wav*</TT> flashing in the title bar to let you know it is recording.
This is fine for sound effects but unfortunately does not work as a way
to create files that can be loaded on real TRS-80's.  Instead you should rely
on the automatic Cassette &rarr; Auto Save feature and use
<A HREF="http://48k.ca/trld.html">my trld program</A> to convert the <TT>.CAS</TT> file to
<TT>.WAV</TT> format.

<P>
The rest of the Record menu entries are meant for programmers and are
<A HREF="Programming.html#prog">documented in the programming section</A>.  I will note
that Record &rarr; MHz Audio records audio files with a very high sampling rate
equal to the Z-80 processor speed.  Most times you do <B>not</B> need that
level of fidelity.

<P>
The <TT>-batch</TT> command line option causes all the Record menu entries
to save to a specific file name to allow for fully automated testing of
trs80gp itself.  It also can be thought of as a way for the emulated TRS-80
to act as a batch processor.  More on this in the
<A HREF="Programming.html#prog">programming section</A>.
