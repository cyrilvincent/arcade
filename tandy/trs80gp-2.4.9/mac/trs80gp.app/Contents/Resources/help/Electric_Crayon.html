<H3><A NAME="ec">Electric Crayon</A></H3>

The Electric Crayon is an external device that provides a colour video
display.  It can work with practically any computer as it connects via
the printer port.  It was primarily targeted at Model 1 and 3 users
as the machines did not have a colour display nor high resolution graphics.

<P>
You may attach an emulated Electric Crayon to trs80gp by using
<TT>-p&nbsp;:ec</TT> on the command line or bringing up the
Printer &rarr; Connection... dialog box and choosing "Electric Crayon"
from the dropdown.  In either case a new instance of trs80gp will
run acting as an Electric Crayon emulator.  When launched this way
the Electric Crayon emulator will go away when you quit the main
trs80gp program.

<P>
Even with an Electric Crayon attached trs80gp still records the
output to the printer in the normal window.  This can be very handy
to capture a drawing or debug a program using the Electric Crayon.

<P>
You can also just run a standalone Electric Crayon emulation via
<TT>trs80gp -mec</TT> and hook it to
another trs80gp emulator using the <TT>-p</TT> command line options
to map TCP/IP connections to the printer port.  The <A HREF="The_Printer.html#print">Printer</A>
section gives some more details on how to do that.

<P>
Although the owner had no direct control over the real Electric Crayon, trs80gp
supports pasting text to its command processor.  Thus even run standalone
you can draw using the usual paste methods: Edit &rarr; Paste, the
input macros or <TT>-i</TT> on the command line.  For example:

<PRE>
       trs80gp -mec -i "A 10 4 HELLO WORLD\r"
</PRE>
</CENTER>

<P>
Not many programs were written for the Electric Crayon.  Here's quick overview
of the available commands so you can write some yourself.  You can get more
detail from the January 1981 issue of 80 Microcomputer.  However, don't miss
out on the fun of playing with the commands and figuring it out yourself.

and most of the usual trs80gp programming features.
