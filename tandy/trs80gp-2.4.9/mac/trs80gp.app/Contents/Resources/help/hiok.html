trs80gp primarily emulates the "gray" line of TRS-80 computers made by Tandy in the
late 1970s and early 1980s.  They are known as the

Model III, Model 4, Model 4P, Model 4D, Model 12, Model 16 and Model 6000.
It is generally easier to use ordinary digits for the Model 1, Model 2 and
Model 3.
The Model 1, 3 and 4 are a line of compatible computers as
is the Model 2, 12, 16 and 6000.
