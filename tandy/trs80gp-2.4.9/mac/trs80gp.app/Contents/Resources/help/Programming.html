<H3><A NAME="prog">Programming</A></H3>

Whether you're writing programs for the TRS-80 or simply wish to
dissect existing programs trs80gp has much to offer.  As such this section
is rather brief on details.  Please do get in touch with me if you have
questions.

<H4><A NAME="batch">Running Programs</A></H4>

Normally on a TRS-80 programs are run either as <TT>/CMD</TT> files at the
TRS-DOS prompt or loaded from cassette with CLOAD or SYSTEM commands.
This is the best way to test programs you write but only needs to be done as a
final test.  For development trs80gp will directly load programs from
the command line or via the File &rarr; Run... menu or via drag and drop.
This is largely similar to standard procedure but does has its differences.
Existing TRS-80 games often work well when run directly but there's no guarantee.

<H4><A NAME="batch">Batch Mode</A></H4>

Activate batch mode using the <TT>-batch</TT> command line option.  In
this mode many operations (most in the Record menu) will not prompt for
a file name but will instead simple write the file to some fixed file name.
This may seem odd but is very useful for testing your programs or trs80gp
itself.  One way to use this is to have your program write status information
to the printer (out $F8 will do on Model 3,4) and use the
<A HREF="Programming.html#ee">emulator extensions</A> to make trs80gp exit.  You can then
run it using:

<PRE>
     trs80gp -m4 -ee program.cmd
</PRE>

And it will go through its paces writing output to <TT>trs80-printer.txt</TT>.
If trs80gp doesn't exit then you know your program went wrong.

<P>
In batch mode many of the menu entries switch to saving files without
prompting.  In most cases those files are named in sequence starting
with <TT>file-0.txt</TT>, <TT>file-1.txt</TT> and so on.  Those are
represented by <TT>file-%d.txt</TT>.

<P>
It is worth re-iterating that <A HREF="Keyboard.html#autoin">automated input</A> options
are tantamount to scripting control over the emulated TRS-80 and can be used
to build up automated tests of your TRS-80 programs.


<H4><A NAME="debug">Z-80 Debugger</A></H4>

The Z-80 debugger may be activated at any time using Debug &rarr; Z-80 Debugger...
It will also come up automatically when a breakpoint is hit.  Breakpoints can
be set interactively in the debugger window in the section just below
the "Go" button.  Breakpoints cover a range of addresses from the value
in the left box to the one in the right which will be filled in semi-automatically
to specify a single address.  Make sure to tick the checkbox next to the
start address/label to enable the breakpoint.  PC breakpoints can also
be set by double-clicking on the Disassembly sub-window.  

<P>
You may set up to 4 breakpoints of each type.  A "PC Breakpoint" is the
traditional kind which is triggered whenever a program executes in the given
address range.  Other types trigger whenever memory is read or written in
the range or I/O is performed.  These types are useful to find when particular
variables are changed or accessed and finding when devices are accessed.
Breakpoints may also be set on the command
line by the <TT>-b</TT>, <TT>-bm</TT>, <TT>-bio</TT> and related options.

<P>
A <TT>&gt;</TT> appears in the disassembly window to indicate the next
instruction to execute and an asterisk (<TT>*</TT>) to show any active
PC breakpoints.

<P>
Memory and I/O breakpoints (or if the Z-80 has set breakpoints using the
the <A HREF="Programming.html#ee">Emulator Extensions</A>) show extra information in the
debug window when they are triggered.
The Disassembly sub-window will show a <TT>!</TT> to indicate
the instruction that caused the fault and additional letter codes
indicating what kind of fault or faults occurred.  The <TT>&gt;</TT> will
point to the next instruction to execute as usual.

<PRE>
       R      Read protected memory
       W      Write protected memory
       E      Execute protected memory
       S      Stack protected memory
       I      Input protected I/O
       O      Output protected I/O
</PRE>

Various sub-windows show the current Z-80 register contents with them displayed
in red if they changed during the previous step.  All values are displayed
in hexadecimal except for the T-state and cycles counters.
There is also a view of
the top of the stack and a T-state counter which can be changed as desired
to measure intervals interactively.

<P>
The Step button moves execution forward a single instruction.  Step Over
sets a breakpoint after the current instruction and resumes execution.  This
is useful for <TT>CALL</TT>s to run quickly though a subroutine.  Grizzled
Z-80 programmers know there's no guarantee a <TT>CALL</TT> will return right
after itself so caveat emptor.  "Go" resumes execution until the next breakpoint
or protection violation.  The "Emulator Extensions" checkbox may be
turned off to disable protection checks.

<P>
When single stepping the display will turn gray to give an indication where
the CRT beam is at that moment in execution.  There are also boxes in the
lower left which give the CRT beam raster Y and X coordinates.  The debugger
is still operational when the TRS-80 is running.  You can change registers and
memory locations which will show a light-blue background to indicate you've
frozen your view of them so you may change it.

<P>
Since the screen shows the contents of the previous frame and the drawing of
the current frame you will not usually see an immediate change when writing
to screen memory.  It only shows up when the CRT beam reads and draws it.
The debugger memory view gives you the ability to see immediate changes to
the various different RAM systems.  The defaults is "Z-80 Memory" which shows
the Z-80's view of its 65536 memory locations.  In the Model 1 and 3 this
will show the BASIC ROM in the first 12 or 14 K or memory, the keyboard
matrix from $3800 to $3BFF, the video RAM from $3C00 to $3FFF and ordinary
RAM from $4000 up to $FFFF or less if a value lower than 48 was given to
the <TT>-mem</TT> command line option.  There may be no memory for some
of the address space (e.g., $3000 .. $37FF on the Model I).  Such regions
will display as <TT>~ff</TT> (or <TT>~00</TT> on the Model II) and cannot
be changed.

<P>
You can also select just the RAM to focus on the 48K of memory.  But keep
in mind these other views use their own addressing.  The RAM view starts at 0
but that is seen (by the Model 1 and 3) as starting at $4000.  The amount
and type of each varies depending on the Model but you'll typically see 
Text VRAM for the usual character display, and Hires VRAM for the high
resolution graphics option (which is usually only accessible to the Z-80
through I/O ports).

<P>
You can search through memory by typing a string into the search box.
The usual backslash escapes can be used for control and graphics characters:
<TT>\n</TT>, <TT>\r</TT>, <TT>\t</TT> and <TT>\HH</TT> for any hexadecimal value.
If the string starts with <TT>$</TT> then the rest is taken to be
hexadecimal digits with spaces ignored.
The <TT>&lt;</TT> and </TT>&gt;</TT> buttons cycle through the matches
which are highlighted in the memory window below.

<P>
In a clunky way RAM can be changed.  The easiest approach to to select
a memory byte and write a new hexadecimal value for it.  The emulator
simply reads back the memory dump so you can also delete a line and
enter any address followed by a colon and a series of space-separated
hexadecimal bytes to change memory locations without having to look at
them.

<P>
A few pseudo-memory regions are viewable but not changeable.  They
are intended to give a partial view of the TRS-80 hardware state.

<PRE>
   Z-80 Device        What the Z-80 would return if an I/O were read.
   Z-80 Port Writes   The last value written by the Z-80 to a port.
   Z-80 Port Reads    The last value read from an I/O port by the Z-80.
</PRE>

<P>
At the bottom of the window are line of check boxes and drop-downs to
control <A HREF="Programming.html#trace">bus tracing</A> which is discussed later.

<P>
Most of the Z-80 register state shown is familiar to Z-80 programmers
and can be directly altered by Z-80 programs.  The <TT>IFF1</TT> checkbox
is checked when interrupts are enabled (by an <TT>EI</TT>) instruction
and not when they are disabled by a <TT>DI</TT> instruction or entry into
an interrupt routine.  Relatedly, <TT>IM</TT> shows the interrupt mode
of the processor which pretty much has to be 1 for Model 1, 3 and 4 computers
and 2 for the Model 2 line.  The <TT>I</TT> register is mostly only relevant
in interrupt mode 2.

<P>
Other state is not directly accessible and pretty much just showing off how
accurate trs80gp's Z-80 emulation is.

<P>
<TT>WZ</TT> is an internal temporary register used by Z-80 during various
16 bit operations.  In an officially undocumented but reliable quirk of
implementation bits 3 and 5 of this register are put into bits 3 and 5 of
the flag register <TT>F</TT> whenever a <TT>BIT</TT> test is done on
<TT>(HL))</TT>.  Early investigators of this called the register MEMPTR.
Google "Z80 MEMPTR" or try
<A HREF="https://gist.github.com/drhelius/8497817">this link</A>
to learn more.

<P>
<TT>EXX</TT>, <TT>AFAF'</TT>, <TT>DEHL</TT> and <TT>DE'HL'</TT> show the
state of internal flip-flops that select different banks of registers
when <TT>EXX</TT>, <TT>EX AF,AF'</TT> and <TT>EX DE,HL</TT> instructions
are executed.  Effectively they show the number of times modulo 2
each instruction has been executed but the Z-80 program and trs80gp's
Z-80 debugger show the currently active sets are you would expect.

<P>
The dropdown shows special Z-80 processor states and will spend 99.999% of
its time in <TT>Normal</TT> mode.  The other modes are:

<UL>
<LI>IntrDis - An <TT>EI</TT> instruction was just executed so the Z-80 will
not respond to a maskable interrupt until the next instruction finishes
execution.
<LI> Halt - The Z-80 has executed a <TT>HALT</TT> instruction and will not
resume execution until an interrupt occurs.  During this time it will continue
to fetch and ignore the opcode of the current instruction.
<LI> Pfix, PfIy - The Z-80 is in the middle of a series of <TT>$DD</TT>
and <TT>$FD</TT> bytes.  The Z-80 only pays attention to the last byte
in such a series to determine if it has an <TT>IX</TT> ($DD) or
<TT>IY</TT> ($FD) instruction.  The Z-80 cannot be interrupted during this
processing but for practical reasons trs80gp breaks such sequences down to a
progression of artificial <TT>pfix</TT> and <TT>pfiy</TT> instructions.
<LI> PostIff2 - The Z-80 has just executed a <TT>LD A,I</TT> or <TT>LD A,R</TT>
instruction which will read the wrong value of <TT>IFF2</TT> if an interrupt
occurs at the same time as the instruction.  This is to emulate a Z-80 bug
and, unlike the others, does not correspond to a real internal state latch.
</UL>

<P>
The debugger also provides a sub-window for watching expressions.
For each expression you choose what result to show: The memory byte or word
at the calculated value, or the value itself (or the high/or low byte of the value)

<P>
Expressions use C-like syntax consisting of:
<UL>
<LI>Decimal constants (use <TT>$</TT> or <TT>0x</TT> to prefix hexadecimal constants)
<LI>Parenthesis to control order of evaluation
<LI>C number operations: <TT>+ - * / %</TT>
<LI>C bit operations: <TT>! ~ &lt;&lt; >> & ^ |</TT>
<LI>C comparisons: <TT>== != &lt; > &lt;= >=</TT>
<LI>C logical and/or: <TT>&& ||</TT>
<LI>Register names: e.g. <TT>A B C AF HL IX AF'</TT>
<LI>Register flags: e.g. <TT>F.C, F.N</TT>
<LI>Source code symbol values (if loaded)
</UL>

There is a special syntax for reading memory inside an expression.
The expressions <TT>(expr)b</TT> and <TT>(expr)w</TT> return the
value of the byte or word at the memory location inside the expression.

<H4><A NAME="src">Source Level Debugging</A></H4>

My <A HREF="http://48k.ca/zmac.html">zmac</A> cross assembler will output machine
language programs in <TT>.bds</TT> format.  It is a text format so by
looking at it and the zmac source code you can probably figure out how
to generate it yourself.  But the important part here is that loading
<TT>.bds</TT> files from the command line will enable source level
debugging.

<P>
Use Debug &rarr; Source Code to bring up the source code that has been loaded.
It will look a bit like an assembler listing file.  The current program
location will be highlighted and follow the execution of the Z-80.

<P>
The format also defines symbolic labels so you can type these labels
in to the breakpoint or register windows instead of having to look up
the hexadecimal values yourself.  You can also use labels for the <TT>-b</TT>
and other command line option to set breakpoints.

<P>
In certain situations you may want to have symbols available for a program
but don't wish to load it into memory.  The <TT>-ls</TT> command line option
and File &rarr; Load Symbols... menu entry are used to only load the symbols
from a <TT>.bds</TT> file.  Doing so allows you to use symbolic names in
the debugger but does not alter RAM contents in case the program is already
underway.

<H4><A NAME="diskview">Disk Viewer</A></H4>

Under the Debug menu there is a Disk Viewer which allows you to browse
through all the floppy and hard drive images inserted and examine their data.
There is a search feature to look for strings or binary data.
The usual backslash escapes can be used for control and graphics characters:
<TT>\n</TT>, <TT>\r</TT>, <TT>\t</TT> and <TT>\HH</TT> for any hexadecimal value.
If the string starts with <TT>$</TT> then the rest is taken to be
hexadecimal digits with spaces ignored.
The <TT>&lt;</TT> and <TT>&gt;</TT> buttons will cycle through all the matches.

<P>
Use the drop downs to select disk images, sides, tracks and sectors.  The
sector dropdown presents both the physical and logical sector numbers.  The
logical number is the value written on the disk and is what is used when
we generically refer to reading or writing sector N.  The physical number
is the relative position of the sector in the track.

<H4><A NAME="devmap">Device Map</A></H4>

The debug menu also features the somewhat experimental "Device Map" feature.
It gives you a quick overview of the current mappings of Z-80 address and
I/O space to RAM and devices.  In short, something like the typical memory
map seen in programmer guides.  Do keep in mind that it shows the mapping
when it was brought up.  If the program subsequently switches memory maps
the window will not be updated.

<P>
The feature is experimental mainly because it doesn't yet display all
the emulator implicitly knows about the address space.  For example,
the Model I does not have any memory mapped from $3000 to $36FF but the
map will display that as read-only RAM.  And it says nothing at all about
the memory mapped printer and floppy disk devices accessible in the
$3700 - $37FF range.  In other words, the map can be incomplete or misleading.
But it seems more handy having it around even with its current shortcomings.

<H4><A NAME="arec">Advanced Recording</A></H4>

Sometimes examining memory in the debugger is too cumbersome.  The
"Text VRAM", "Graphics VRAM", "RAM", "RAM16" and "Expansion RAM" entries
in the "Record" menu will save those RAM areas to a file where you can
use external tools to do a more thorough analysis.

<P>
The normal <A HREF="Recording.html#record">recording</A> options can assist debugging.
It may be helpful to step through a video a frame at a time to see some
graphical glitch in detail.  The "MHz Audio" option takes this to the
extreme by recording audio output a sample rate equal to the speed of
the Z-80.  In effect this lets you see exactly when the audio changes.

<P>
The Trace option is the most useful so I've dedicated
<A HREF="Programming.html#trace">section to it</A>.  The other options attempt to
self-document in their output.  Unlike the Trace option these other
options don't record everything.  Typically they'll just track the
PC values to keep overhead low.  When they do their final output
the use whatever value is in RAM at the time for the disassembly.
If the program changes you may seen confusing output.  This gets even
worse if the memory mapping changes.

<P>
All these recording options can be activated and stopped at any time.
It is useful and often desirable to start them when the program is
stopped in the debugger and then stop them at the next breakpoint after
an interesting subroutine or full step of a game simulation has run.

<P>Record &rarr; Z-80 Profile tracks every instruction executed and shows you a list
of those instructions, the number of times each instruction was executed
and the total T-States spent on each instruction.  It is intended to
help measure where your program spends its time to be used as a guide
for optimization.  It can also be used to simply track what a program
as done during an interval.  However, "Bus Use" is better for that task
and <A HREF="Programming.html#trace">Trace</A> will show every instruction in order.

<P>Record &rarr; Backtrace show the last 65536 instructions executed.  In theory
you can use this to respond to a crash.  But practically speaking that many
instructions is at most a tenth of a second so you're not likely to be quick
enough to catch it.

<P>Record &rarr; Bus Use tracks the execution of a program.  The output is
much like a disassembler but with markup indicating how memory was accessed:
read, written, executed, jumped to, called and so on.  The disassembly tends
to be better than a static disassembly since it uses the Z-80's execution
path to point out what is code and what is data.

<P>The disassembly will be entirely commented out except for any areas where
a program was loaded by the command line (or using File &rarr; Load/Run) into
memory.  The intent here is to distinguish the loaded program from the ROM
or operating system routines it uses.  If the program is sufficiently put
through its paces the result should be a good disassembly that can be
assembled to produce the original code.  Unlike the other trace options any
data uncommented in the disassembly is based on the original data loaded so
it won't be fooled by simple self-modifying code.  However, this is a problem
if the program relocates itself.  In which case you'll have to get a relocated
version of the program loaded.  At least "Bus Use" will help understand the
relocator code.

<H4><A NAME="ee">Emulator Extensions</A></H4>

These are enabled by the <TT>-ee</TT> command line option.  They can be
turned off using the "Emulator Extensions" checkbox in the Z-80 Debugger.
A Z-80 program accesses them by sending a function code to I/O port $47.
Here is a brief overview:

<PRE>
     0     Set bus permissions for address HL to DE to B
     2     Trigger bus fault B
     3     Disable (B=0) or enable (B=1) bus permissions
     4     Trigger execute fault (i.e., drop into the debugger)
     5     Reset (B=0) or get (B=1, into DEHL) T-state counter
     6     Control recording
              B=$41 - toggle audio recording
              B=$4D - toggle Mhz Audio recording
              B=$47 - toggle animated GIF recording
              B=$46 - toggle Flash video recording
              B=$56 - toggle video recording
              B=$53 - take screenshot
              B=$47 - take cleanshot
   64..127 Set parameter (see below)
     128   exit emulator with return code BC
     255   set carry flag (to detect if extensions active)
</PRE>

Function 5 allows for automated profiling of Z-80 code.  Function 128
is typically used to end a test in batch mode.  The bus permissions are
very helpful in tracking down nasty bugs.  For example, you can set your
code section to execute-only.  The emulator will trap into the debugger
the instant something tries to overwrite over your code.  Or even read it.
Another useful technique is turning off stack permissions at the bottom
and top of your stack to detect stack overflow or underflow.

<P>For function 0 the lower 7 bits in B are set to indicate what Z-80
operation is allowed on that memory location.  Or for the first 256
addresses what I/O operation is allowed on a port.  Those bits are:

<PRE>
   Mask    Operation  Z-80 Debugger letter indicator
     1     Read       R
     2     Write      W
     4     Execute    E
     8     Stack      S
     16    In         I
     32    Out        O
     64    DMA        D
</PRE>

<P>Stack permission is required for CALL, RET, PUSH, POP, RETI and RETN.

<P>For BASIC where <TT>OUT</TT> is readily available but controller register
contents is difficult there a way to trigger any function with just OUT
commands.

<P>
<TT>OUT 71,32+n</TT> will trigger function <TT>n</TT> using whatever parameters
were previously set.  A parameter is set by first doing an <TT>OUT 71,64+p</TT>
where <TT>p</TT> is the parameter number and then doing <TT>OUT 71,x</TT> to
set the value.  If a command requires a register then the parameter triggered
version of the command will read parameter 2 for register B, parameter 3 for
register C, parameter 8 for H and so on.  Or put another way, you select
the parameter for register R by sending the ascii value of the register letter.

<P>
For example, this will toggle animated GIF recording:
<PRE>
    OUT 71,66:OUT 71,71:OUT 71,32+6
</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="trace">Bus Trace</A></H4>

The Record &rarr; Trace feature is a very powerful and comprehensive tool for
debugging Z-80 programs and the emulator itself.  It can log every
instruction executed, memory access, interrupt and I/O port access the
Z-80 or any DMA device does.  It also places markers in the output file
to indicate when a frame has ended and when one second of execution has
finished.  It can be activated a program start with the <TT>-trace</TT>
option.  The full log is recorded in the output file.  The last frame
or two of the log can be viewed using Debug &rarr; Trace Log...

<P>
The output can be voluminous.  You'll want to use breakpoints to
turn tracing on and off for as short a period as possible.  The "Tracing"
checkpoint in the Z-80 Debugger is a convenient shortcut.  And there
are additional check boxes to enable or disable tracing for Z-80
instruction, I/O accesses, memory accesses and interrupts.

<P>
For even finer control I/O logging can be enabled on a per-device basis.
This is handled by the device drop-down.  The interface is awkward.
As you select each device in the drop-down the checkmark to the right
changes to indicate if that device is being logged.  But you still must
check the I/O box to enable I/O logging.  To make it more confusing but
usable the best course is to turn I/O off, select the device you're
interested in, enable it and then turn I/O back on.  If you turn I/O
on first it will enable all devices by default.

<P>
Yes, it's bad but at least it gives some way to target particular devices.
Obviously these controls should be in some other window but the debugger
happened to be handy at the time.  trs80gp wasn't built in a day.

<P>
The actual logging looks something like this:

<PRE>
   8033317 @3018 z ex       jp     $35c2
   8033327 @35c2 z ex       push   af
       +11 @35c2 z wr _ffb4 00 ram[ffb4]
       +11 @35c2 z wr _ffb3 44 ram[ffb3]
   8033338 @35c3 z ex       in     a,($e0)
       +11 @35c3 z in _e0 fb
   8033349 @35c5 z ex       rra
   8033353 @35c6 z ex       jp     nc,$3365
   8033363 @35c9 z ex       rra
   8033367 @35ca z ex       jp     nc,$3369
   8033377 @35cd z ex       push   bc
       +11 @35cd z wr _ffb2 38 ram[ffb2]
       +11 @35cd z wr _ffb1 80 ram[ffb1]
</PRE>

The first column is the T-State counter.  The second is the PC of the Z-80
when the operation occurred.  Next a letter code shows the device responsible
('z' for Z-80 and 'd' for DMA chip).  The type of access follows.  Most
are "ex" for instruction execution with a disassembly of the instruction
following.  But for reads, writes, ins and outs (rd, wr, in, ot) the
memory or I/O address is shown followed by the value read or written.
Other possible operations are:

After any access there may be a description of what the value means to that
device and possibly the internal state of the device.  A good example is
the CRTC video controller chip used in the Model 2 and 4.  An I/O write (out) to
its address register will be annotated with the name of the register
selected.  An I/O write will show the name of the register changed and
its current value.  Some devices are very simple in that any byte read
or written can only have one meaning.  But for the CRTC a write to a register
depends on which register was previously selected.  Without the annotation
you would have to search backwards for the last register selection.  And
if the register is 16 bits wide you'd also have to look back for the last
time that other 8 bits were changed.  This is tedious and may not even appear
in the bus trace you've made.

<P>
Not all devices provide annotations.  If they do then you can bet they were
giving us trouble in developing the emulator.  Most of the Model 2 devices
have annotations.

<P>
By the way, the underscore and @ signs in front of addresses are intentional
and useful.  vi (and maybe other editors) make it easy to search on words.
So starting a search on _ffb2 will only find other references to that
memory location being read or written.  But searching the word ffb2 will
find instructions that reference the address.  Or you can search for @ffb2
explicitly to restrict your search to only instructions executed at that
address.
