<H3><A NAME="print">The Printer</A></H3>

Many different types of printers could be attached to a TRS-80.  The
emulator supports a simple text mode printer.  Use Printer &rarr; Printer...
to see the current output in a "Printer Output" window.  There's a
Save button to save the output to a file.
<P>
The printer window can automatically pop up when the emulator prints
something.  Use Printer &rarr; Auto Popup to enable this feature.  You
can also simulate a powered-down (or disconnected) printer with
Printer &rarr; On.
<P>
Like the serial ports the printer port can be mapped to a TCP/IP connection.
To listen for a connection use <TT>-p&nbsp;@port</TT> or the "TCP/IP Listen"
option in the Printer &rarr; Connection... dialog.  To make a connection
use <TT>-p&nbsp;host:port</TT> or "TCP/IP Connect" in the connection dialog.
<P>
To attach an emulated MX-70 printer use <TT>-p :mx70</TT> on the command line
or use Printer &rarr; Connection... and select it from the drop-down.
<P>
The Electric Crayon colour display actually attaches via the printer port.
The idea was to make it easy to program.  For example, a BASIC
<TT>LPRINT"ERS"</TT> will erase the screen.  See the section on
the <A HREF="Electric_Crayon.html#ec">Electric Crayon</A> for some details on how to use it.

<P>
In batch mode and TRS-80 printer output is written to a file
called <TT>trs80-printer.txt</TT>.
