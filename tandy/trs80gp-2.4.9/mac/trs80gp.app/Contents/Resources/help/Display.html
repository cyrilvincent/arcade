<H3><A NAME="display">Display</A></H3>

By default trs80gp starts in authentic display mode.  This mode
looks most like the original TRS-80 display and scales very well to fit any
window size.  It is selected with <TT>-va</TT> or View &rarr; Authentic Display.

<P>
For a less realistic but still scalable display there is View &rarr; Sharp Display
or the <TT>-vs</TT> flag.  In this mode pixels are drawn as tiny rectangles
in a single colour rather than the fuzzy dots that are brightest in the middle
used in authentic mode.

<P>
Since the sharp display doesn't look as good at some scales due to poorer
antialiasing there is View &rarr; Fixed Sharp Display or <TT>-vi</TT>.  While
the window can be resized in this mode the display will only use whole number
scales (e.g., 1X, 2X, 3X, etc.) to make the display look as sharp as possible.

<P>
Finally there is View &rarr; Cheap Display or <TT>-vh</TT>.  It will
scale up in whole number jumps it always maintains a correspondence between
TRS-80 pixels and PC display pixels even if the aspect ratio is not the
same as the original TRS-80 display.  The Model I mode is particularly
distorted and the window size will change when a Model 4 switches between
80 and 64 character modes.  This mode is mainly of benefit to PCs with
small displays or less processing power.  It is also useful for testing since
the mapping from the resulting pixels to TRS-80 graphics is simpler.

<P>
While ignored in authentic mode, <TT>-vN</TT> can be used on the command line
to start the emulator at a fixed display scale (e.g., <TT>-v3</TT> for 3X scaling).
In any mode <TT>-win WxH</TT> can set the starting window size to W x H.

<P>
trs80gp can start in full screen mode (showing no menu bar, window borders
or system elements) using <TT>-vf</TT> or <TT>-win full</TT>.  Use the
View &rarr; Fullscreen menu entry to switch to full screen mode at any time
or toggle between fullscreen and windowed with the <TT>Alt-Enter</TT> keyboard
shortcut.  Or use the right-click context menu.
Full screen mode is nice for
those whose eyesight isn't what it used to be or if you want your PC to feel
more like a real TRS-80 instead of an emulation.

<P>
The View &rarr; Controls dialog allows additional control over the display.
There are sliders to adjust the brightness and contrast of the display much
like the original TRS-80.  It even permits adjustments that leave the display
dimmed or brightened beyond readability.

<P>
The display colour can be changed from the usual bluish-white to any colour
you like with quick presets for Green, Amber and white.  Similarly the colour
used to show beam conflicts (a programmer feature, more on that below) can
also be changed from the default blue.  Changes to colours become the default
on a per-model basis.  I personally like my Model 4 display green and amber
for the Model 2.  The <TT>-vc</TT> and <TT>-vd</TT> command line options can
change the display colour without saving it as a default.  Or they can
specify the factory default by using <TT>-</TT> as the colour
(e.g., <TT>-vc -</TT>).

<P>
Under Windows trs80gp remembers the display mode and window positions for
each particular model.  The windows can be set up just the way you like them
and will be in those positions the next time you run.  If you run more than
one trs80gp emulator for a model at once the second and subsequent instances
will have their own set of window positions and display settings.  They will
also indicate the instance as a <TT>#2</TT>, <TT>#3</TT>, etc. in the
window title bar.

<H4>Beam Debug</H4>

View &rarr; Beam Debug (or <TT>-bd</TT>) turns on beam debug mode which is
used to illustrate when the Z-80 and video circuitry conflict over access to
display memory.  When this happens on a real TRS-80 the video display will
show short black streaks (or white in hires) instead of the actual data
displayed.  This was most prevalent on the Model I and was colloquially
referred to as "screen hash" or "snow" or "raster lines".  The Model 3 has
this to a generally lesser extent.  It should appear in Model 4 hires modes
and on the Model 2 but, much to my shame, I have not written that emulation yet.

<P>
In "Beam Debug" mode these dropouts are instead coloured in blue to made them
even more noticeable but yet show what would have been displayed had there
been no conflict in shades of blue.  This is very helpful for getting the
timing right when development programs that write to the display with very
precise timing to increase effective display resolution. For instance, see
<A HREF="http://48k.ca/ball.html">my bouncing ball demo</A>.  Beam debug mode reveals how
it secretly writes to the display where it is already black so beam conflict
remains hidden from view.

<P>
This mode also shows the V-Blank and H-Blank portions of the display as
rectangular regions below and to the right of the usual display respectively.
Z-80 access to video memory during those times will show up as beam conflicts
even though there is no actual conflict.  Instead they function as a sort of
oscilloscope to show when the Z-80 is accessing video memory.  H-Blank or
"Horizontal Blank" is the short time when the CRT electron beam is moving
from the end of a display line to the start of the next one.  V-Blank or
"Vertical Blank" is a longer interval when the beam is moving from the bottom
of the display to the top.

<P>
Beam Debug is not supported by the authentic display mode so if activated it
will automatically switch the TRS-80 to cheap display mode.
