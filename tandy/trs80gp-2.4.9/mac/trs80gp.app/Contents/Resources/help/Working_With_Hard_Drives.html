<H3><A NAME="hd">Working With Hard Drives</A></H3>

The Hard Drive menu can attach up to 4 drives.
There are only unformatted hard drive images built-in so you will have to
either supply your own or go through the process of formatting and otherwise
setting up the emulated hard drive for use under your choice of emulated
operating system.

<P>
Selecting Hard Drive &rarr; :slot &rarr; &lt;&lt; unformatted hdv &gt;&gt;
(or "emu" or "DREM") will
connect an unformatted hard drive image to the selected controller slot.
It will immediately prompt for a file to save the hard drive data.
This is unlike the diskettes which will track changes internally and only
ask to save when they are ejected.

<P>
On the command line use <TT>-h :hdv</TT> (or <TT>:emu</TT> or <TT>:drem</TT>)
to attach a blank hard drive image and <TT>-hx</TT> to disable the hard drive
controller.

<P>
The "drem" format is compatible with the DREM hard drive emulator available
at <A HREF="https://www.drem.info/">https://www.drem.info/</A>.  It stores
hard drive images as a pair of files.  A <TT>file.cfg</TT> which gives the
geometry and other information and a <TT>file.dsk</TT> which holds the data
for all the blocks.

<P>
The "emu" format is compatible with the Gesswein MFM emulator available at
<A HREF="https://www.pdp8online.com/mfm/mfm.shtml">https://www.pdp8online.com/mfm/mfm.shtml</A>.
Both the "drem" and "emu" formats allow for convenient copying of hard drive
images to or from real TRS-80's.

<P>
FreHD emulation is not generally compatible with the Model II hard drive.
Model II operating systems like the built in TRSDOS-2.0a which are unaware
of the hard drive can import and export files using the FreHD utilities.
But TRSDOS-II will fail to boot with <TT>-frehd</TT> enabled.
