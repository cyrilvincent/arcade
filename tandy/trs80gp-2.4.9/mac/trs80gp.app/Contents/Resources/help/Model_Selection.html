<H3><A NAME="mdl">Model Selection</H3>

The various <TT>-m*</TT> options and the File &rarr; Change Model menu from
quite a wide variety of different computers, terminals and printers to emulate.
When trs80gp is run from the command line the model will default to <TT>-m3</TT>.
When run from a GUI the model will be whatever was selected by the menu.
In either case various preferences like display mode defaults are recalled
based on the model.

<P>
Many of the command line arguments may not be applicable vary depending on
the model.  For example, printers and terminals do not have cassette or disk
storage and ignore those options.  One meaningful difference is the
<TT>-r0, -r1, -r2, etc.</TT> ROM revision.  The lower the revision number
the earlier the original release of that ROM.  Here is a table of revisions
for each model which have more that one:

<P>
Both the Model I and Model III have Level I and Level II BASIC ROMs.  The
rom revsisions only select between different Level II ROMs.  There is only
one known version of the Level I ROMs for each.
