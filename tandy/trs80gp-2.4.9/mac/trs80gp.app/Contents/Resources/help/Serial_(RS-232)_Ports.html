<H3><A NAME="serial">Serial (RS-232) Ports</A></H3>

trs80gp can map serial ports to TCP/IP connections or emulate 2 and 3 button
serial mice.  To have a serial port connect to a TCP/IP server use
<TT>-r&nbsp;host:port</TT> or open Serial &rarr; Port A, fill in the hostname
and port and choose "TCP/IP Connect".  Or the serial port can listen on a
TCP/IP port with <TT>-r&nbsp;@port</TT> or use "TCP/IP Listen" in the serial
port dialog box.  Most machines have a single serial port, the Model 2 line
has two ports accessible on the command line with <TT>-rA</TT> and <TT>-rB</TT>.

<P>
trs80gp instances can now be "wired" together through serial ports.
The ultimate setup is one trs80gp running Model 16 Xenix with two trs80gp's
attached running DT-1 terminals.  But here's a simple example of hooking
two DT-1 terminal emulations together.

<PRE>
     trs80gp -mdt1 -r :4000
     trs80gp -mdt1 -r @4000
</PRE>

Characters typed on one of the DT-1's will appear on the second one.  Assuming
everything is working. If it does not work check the "Status" indicator of each
serial port.  Both sides should note they are "connected".  But the "@" side
may only show "Listening..." or the other side "Connecting..." both indicating
no connection has been made.  Or "-unbound-" if there has been some error.

<P>
To break a connection use the "None" option in the dialog box dropdown.  The
other side may not see the loss of connection so you may need to manually
manage "unplugging" on both sides.  trs80gp is not quite ready to be an
internet "dial-up" BBS.

<P>
The status will also show the current transmission settings of the serial port.
Baud rate, bits per word, parity and number of stop bits.  These do not affect
TCP/IP connections but the emulation will limit transmit and receive speeds
based on port setup.  Most original TRS-80 hardware could be set up to have
different transmit and receive speeds.  That unlikely configuration will be
hidden from view.  In the Model 2 line the higher baud rate settings are not
exact.  trs80gp will display the exact baud rate (feature or bug? You tell me).

<P>
As a convenience trs80gp can launch <A HREF="DT-1_Terminal.html#dt1">DT-1</A> and
<A HREF="TRS-80_Videotex.html#videotex">Videotex</A> terminals directly from the command line
or in the serial port connection dialog.  For example, you might launch a
two terminal Xenix system with:

<PRE>
     trs80gp -m6000 -h xenix33.cfg -rA :dt1 -rB :dt1
</PRE>

Or you can choose the desired terminal from the dropdown in the
serial port connection dialog.  Either way, these terminals will act
as a unit with the main trs80gp emulator.  If you exit the main emulator
the terminals will also be forced to exit.

<P>There is not yet a facility to map serial ports to real serial ports on
the host machine.
