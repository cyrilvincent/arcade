Some trs80gp features are only available through the command line.  The
easiest way to run from the command line is use the <TT>open</TT> command.
For example, here is how to start trs80gp in Model I mode with the PCG-80
programmable character graphics generator enabled:

<PRE>
    open trs80gp.app --args -m1 -pcg-80
</PRE>

You can run the executable directly which may be preferable in some cases.
Just use the path to it inside the trs80gp.app directory.  Here's how to
start a Model II in turbo mode:

<PRE>
    trs80gp.app/Contents/MacOS/trs80gp -m2 -turbo
</PRE>
