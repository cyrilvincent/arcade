<H3><A NAME="otherinp">Light Pen and Joystick</A></H3>

The Windows version supports joystick input on the Model 1, 3 and 4 and
light pen input on the Model 1.  The light pen must be enabled with the
<TT>-lp</TT> option; the joystick can be disabled with the <TT>-jx</TT> option.

<P>
An Alpha products joystick is emulated using any of the standard joysticks
attached to your computer.  The actual joystick was a bus hog that would
respond to reads on practically any I/O port.  Most programs use port $00, $13
or $F7 so only those are mapped by trs80gp.

<P>
With the light pen enabled pressing the mouse button down will simulate the
light pen making contact with that position on screen.  Releasing the mouse
button acts as if the pen were removed from the screen.  Very few programs
were found that have light pen support so please report any problems you
see.  We'd be very much interested to run some test programs if you have
an original light pen.
