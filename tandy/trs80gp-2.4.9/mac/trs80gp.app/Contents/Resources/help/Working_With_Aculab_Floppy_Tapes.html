<H3><A NAME="wafer">Working With Aculab Floppy Tapes</A></H3>

The Wafer menu shows all 8 tape drives and what wafer image is inserted
in them or <TT>&lt;empty&gt;</TT> if there is none.  Any wafer name
enclosed in <TT>&lt;&lt;&nbsp;..&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</TT> is a built-in wafer
image.  If the name has an asterisk (<TT>*</TT>) before it the wafer has been
modified and must exported to be saved.  For non-internal wafer images the
changes are saved automatically.  trs80gp will prompt to save modified
wafer images when you try to eject them or exit the emulator.

<P>
All built-in wafer images have a <A HREF="Working_With_Aculab_Floppy_Tapes.html#intwafer">short name</A>
that starts with a colon. This is displayed in parenthesis on each entry
in the "Insert wafer..." menu as a reminder that the short name can be used
on the command line to insert the wafer when starting trs80gp.

<P>
Each drive has a sub-menu that lets you eject, replace, insert, export to a
new file or toggle the write protection of a wafer image.
This isn't the read-only flag of the PC file system but an internal one
corresponding to the physical write protect sticker on real floppy tapes.

<P>
You can also use the Wafer menu to manage files on the image.  The menu
shows a list of files on the wafer. Selecting one will prompt to save it
to your PC.  A Delete sub-menu also lists the files and selecting an entry
will delete that file from the wafer.  Finally, the Import... menu lets
you copy files from the PC into the wafer image.  Because the Aculab firmware
may have a copy of a sector in memory is best to <B><TT>@LIST</TT> a drive
before and after doing any file imports or deletes</B>.

<P>
Whenever a wafer is accessed trs80gp will go into turbo mode automatically.
This can be enabled or disabled with the Wafer &rarr; Auto Turbo menu.

<P>
The Wafer &rarr; Manual... brings up brief instructions how to activate
and use the Aculab Floppy and access the files from within the TRS-80.

<H4>.tape File Format</H4>

Aculab floppy tape wafers are stored in <TT>.tape</TT> format which is
designed to hold not only those images but also Exatron Stringy Floppy
images and cassette tapes in various formats.  It maintains 99% backwards
compatibility by putting an identifying trailer at the end of the file.
Simple formats such as <TT>.cas</TT> will see the trailer as noise at
the end of the tape while others will simply ignore it.

<P>
The trailer can be up to 255 bytes long and has the following format:

<P>
trs80gp only creates and understands a specific variant of <TT>.tape</TT>
files for Aculab Floppy Tape emulation &mdash; flag bit 2 set, data type
<TT>'d'</TT> and data consisting of concatenated 256 byte sectors from 0
to the tape size.

<P>
When Extratron Stringy Floppy emulation is added to trs80gp it is expected
it will be capable of <TT>.esf</TT> wrapping and bit level encoding.
