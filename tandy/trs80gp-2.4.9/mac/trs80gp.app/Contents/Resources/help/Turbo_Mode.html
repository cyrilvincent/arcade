<H3><A NAME="turbo">Turbo Mode</A></H3>

trs80gp can be explicitly or manually told to enter turbo mode where the
emulated TRS-80 is run faster than real time, sometimes as much as 8 times faster.
The entire system and not just the Z-80 is sped up so any virtual I/O between
cassette and diskette is not affected nor are any active recordings.  It will
try to record faster but the resulting recording will be at normal speed.
Turn off authentic rendering with View &rarr; Authentic Display of the <TT>-na</TT>
command line option to let the TRS-80 run a bit faster.

<P>
Use the <TT>-turbo</TT> command line option to have it run constantly in
turbo mode.  Or hold the <TT>F12</TT> key for a temporary speed boost.
<TT>shift-F12</TT> will keep turbo mode active without having to hold
<TT>F12</TT> and will turn off when you release <TT>F12</TT>.

<P>
In order to let you experience the TRS-80 in the best light trs80gp
automatically enters turbo mode when doing cassette of diskette I/O.
That can be turned off with the Cassette &rarr; Auto Turbo and
Diskette &rarr; Auto Turbo menus.  

<P>
Normally a turbo mode would cause massive key repeats because your normal
typing speed will appear to the TRS-80 as if each key has been held down
for a very long time.  This is mitigated by trs80gp dropping out of turbo
mode whenever a key is pressed.  Use Keyboard &rarr; Auto De-turbo to turn
off this feature if it isn't a problem for your application.  Typically
games still work fine and you can challenge yourself by playing them at
high speed.

<P>
At the expense of graphical and timing accuracy the emulator can run up
to twice as fast as turbo mode with the <TT>-haste</TT> command line argument
(or by using the File &rarr; Haste menu item).  As the old saying goes,
haste makes waste so only use this when speed is vital.  Besides only
updating the display once per second, "haste" skips wait state calculations
which will throw off the timing of a program that accesses the display.
Any video capture will also be distorted.
