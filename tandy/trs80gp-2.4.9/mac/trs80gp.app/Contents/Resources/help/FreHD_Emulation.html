<H3><A NAME="frehd">FreHD Emulation</A></H3>

The FreHD is a modern-era TRS-80 Model 1, 3 and 4 peripheral which emulates
a hard drive using image files on an SD card.  It was designed by
Frédéric Vecoven in 2013 and is fully
<A HREF="https://github.com/veco/FreHDv1">open source</A> but most users
purchase kits or pre-assembled versions from
<A HREF="http://frehd.com/">Ian Mavric</A>.  The open source hardware
<A HREF="https://github.com/apuder/TRS-IO">TRS-IO</A> (for Model 1, 3 and 4)
also operates in a hardware compatible fashion to the FreHD.

<P>
Since trs80gp can emulate a
hard drive itself, FreHD emulation just means the other handy features of the
FreHD such as the real time clock and access to the host file system for
<A HREF="Working_With_Floppies.html#impexp">file import and export</A>.  It also means you can
experience <A HREF="http://48k.ca/trsvid.html">TRS-80 video</A> and test
your own FreHD files without needing a real TRS-80 or FreHD.

<P>
There are only two FreHD features not implemented.  The <TT>VHDUTIL</TT>
cannot set the clock and you cannot mount floppy disk images through the
FreHD using the special <TT>DSK/DTC</TT> device driver.

<P>
In most cases all that's needed is to copy the contents of a FreHD SD card
to a directory (or simply mount the SD card on your PC) and run:

<PRE>
     trs80gp -m4 -frehd_dir frehd_file_directory
</PRE>

Or use the Hard Drive &rarr; FreHD &rarr; Directory... menu to
accomplish the same thing through the GUI.

<P>
FreHD setups often come with patched versions of the TRS-80 Model 1, 3 or 4
ROMs that will boot from the FreHD when the machine is powered on.  Normally
they will only boot from floppy disk and require a special boot floppy that
boots with the hard drive active.  Add the <TT>-frehd_patch</TT> option or
use Hard Drive &rarr; FreHD &rarr; ROM Patches to have trs80gp act the same way.

<P>
When FreHD emulation is enabled trs80gp will try to connect the image files
<TT>hard4-0</TT>, <TT>hard4-1</TT>, <TT>hard4-2</TT> and <TT>hard4-3</TT>
in the root of the FreHD directory as hard drives 0 through 3 respectively.
But it will only do it when the respective hard drive has no image connected.

<P>
The built-in FreHD loader block can be overriden with a custom 256 byte boot
block using <TT>-frehd_load file.bin</TT> or the
Hard Drive &rarr; FreHD &rarr; Loader... menu entry.
FreHD's auto-boot normally tries to load the FreHD menu from a
<TT>frehd.rom</TT> file in the FreHD directory.
For convenience, trs80gp has a version of the FreHD menu program built-in and
you can activate it with <TT>-frehd_menu</TT> or
Hard Drive &rarr; FreHD &rarr; Built-in Menu.

<H4>The FreHD Boot Sequence</H4>

On a real FreHD changing the loader block requires a rebuild of the firmware.
It is far easier to experiment with such changes on trs80gp.  However, the
FreHD boot sequence is not widely understood so I will go over it in some
detail to help anyone debugging or developing for the FreHD.

<P>
The Model 4P is the only TRS-80 in the 1,3,4 line that has hard drive boot
code in its ROM.  A properly configured hard drive image will boot on the 4P
without any FreHD auto-start patches to the 4P's 4K ROM.

<P>
The FreHD auto-start patches do not add direct hard-drive booting to the
Model 1, 3 or 4.  Instead, just before trying to boot off the floppy,
they load and execute 256 byte FreHD loader block
into RAM location $5000.  If the space-bar is held the loader block will
return to the ROM and the boot will proceed normally.
Otherwise, the loader block will then try to load and
execute the <TT>frehd.rom</TT> menu program from the SD card.  Despite it's
suffix, the <TT>frehd.rom</TT> file is actually in <TT>/CMD</TT> format.

<P>
The FreHD menu program displays a nice splash screen which includes
the version number of the FreHD firmware (as determined by querying the
FreHD itself).  It then uses the FreHDs extended facilities to list
available hard drive images to boot.  When the user selects one it
instructs the FreHD to mount that hard drive image and proceeds to
boot it.

<P>
Booting is mostly a matter of loading the second sector from the hard drive
into $4300 (or $4200 on the Model 1) and executing it.  Before doing so
the FreHD menu will write the current time and date into a few locations.
Most TRS-80 operating systems will check for a valid date in these locations
when they boot and not prompt for one.

<P>
Here is where I am not entirely clear on the exact operation for the FreHD
menu program.  It will also try to make patches to the boot block and perhaps
even the operating system itself.  I believe the intent of these patches it
to allow certain TRS-80 operating system to accept the pre-initialized
time and date.  There may well be other purposes.

<H4>Boot Sequence in Depth</H4>
<P>
Note that you could write your own <TT>frehd.rom</TT> menu program.  And
in the general sense it could do anything you want.  It could just be a
game that auto-boots on the FreHD.  But if you aim to improve the menu
or even make a different loader block then you'll want to
<A HREF="https://github.com/veco/FreHDv1">consult the source code</A>.
And continue reading as I have a few more details on how it all hangs
together.

<P>
On the Model 3 a fairly short sequence of ROM BASIC commands can be used to mimic
the auto-start ROM patch:

<PRE>
     POKE 16912,16
     10 OUT 197,3
     20 IF INP(196)<>254 THEN PRINT"No frehd":END
     30 FORI=0TO255:POKE20480+I,INP(196):NEXT
     RUN
     SYSTEM
     /20480
</PRE>

The same code will work on the Model 4, just change line 10 to output 4.
And on the Model 1 don't do the initial <TT>POKE</TT> and change line 10
to output 1.  The initial poke turns on <TT>EXTIO</TT> in the shadow register
of port $EC.  Without that the FreHD will not see accesses to it.
Note that the program will not work in Disk BASIC since the POKEs will
scramble the extra code loaded by Disk BASIC and crash the program.

<P>
Notice that the loader block must start with $FE or it will be ignored by
the auto-start patch.  That's so the auto-start patch has no effect when
there is no FreHD attached.  It is actually bytes 1 through 255 of loader
block that are put into RAM $5000 (20480).  The last byte at $50FF is the
first byte which is $FE.  The initial <TT>OUT</TT> to port 197 ($C5) serves
two purposes.  It tells the FreHD to start feeding byte 0 and on of the
load block when reads come in on port 196 ($C4).  And it outputs that
value as byte 2 of the loader block.  Since execution begins at byte 1
the loader block must put an instruction there which effectively skips
byte 2.  As such, loader blocks have byte 1 set to $FE which is the
Z-80 <TT>CP A,n</TT> instruction.

<P>
This byte is used by the auto-start patch to indicate to the FreHD menu
program what type of TRS-80 it is running on.  Hence the 1 for Model 2,
3 for Model 3 and 4 for Model 4.  The Model 4P auto-start patch puts in a 5.

<P>
If the loader block cannot find a <TT>frehd.rom</TT> file on the SD card
it will simply return and the TRS-80 will boot as normal.

<P>
Once the FreHD menu program is loaded it will load the model number from
location $5001.  Initially it uses the model number to decide if it should
use the ROM routine to read the keyboard (1, 2, 3, 4) or its own keyboard
scanning for model 5, the 4P.  It then scans the root directory of the SD
card looking for hard drive image files in
<A HREF="http://www.trs-80emulators.com/hdv1-format/">HDV</A> format.
A file must start with the bytes $56 $CB, have bit 0 of byte 8 set (indicating
autoboot) and byte 11, the OS type must be one of:

<PRE>
     0 for LS-DOS 6.3.1
     1 for LDOS 5.3.1
     2 for CP/M
     3 for Newdos 2.5
     4 for Model I LDOS 5.3.1
     5 for Model I NEWDOS 2.5
</PRE>

trs80gp's built-in FreHD menu also experimentally accepts 6 for MULTIDOS.
Files meeting these criteria will be listed for the user to select but with
one more condition for model number 5 (Model 4P).  An OS type of 1 or 3
will only be listed if a 'modela.iii' is on the SD card.  That's because
those are Model III OS's and will only work on the 4P if the ROM image
has been loaded.

<P>
As mentioned before, once an image is selected it will be mounted as hard
drive 0 and the menu will kick off the boot by loading sector 2 from the
hard drive into $4300 (or $4200 if the model number is 1).

<P>
It will also write the current date and time into one or more memory locations
depending on the model number and OS type.  This will make most TRS-80
operating systems skip prompting of the date and time as they are already
initalized.

<P>
Before executing the boot block the FreHD menu system may patch the hard
drive boot block (or even, I think, some of the code loaded by the boot
block) for unclear purposes.  I suspect it is to allow some of the
OS's to accept an initialized date.  And maybe even patch the OS to load
from the hard drive instead of diskette.
The menu will also load the <TT>modeala.iii</TT>
from the SD card on the Model 4P if the OS type is 1 or 3 so those Model 3
operating systems will work on a 4P which does not have the necessary
BASIC ROM to support them.

<P>
After that the FreHD system is out of the picture and the operating systems
boots as it would off a regular hard drive.

<P>
The diligent programmer can make use of the various memory locations
and I/O ports to set breakpoints to inspect the boot process at any point
in its various steps.  Special FreHD operations such as opening and reading
files on the SD card are recognized and displayed clearly in the
<A HREF="Programming.html#trace">bus trace</A> allowing a high level view of what a
program is doing with the FreHD.
